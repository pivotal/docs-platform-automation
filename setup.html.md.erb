This topic describes how to install Platform Automation for PCF.

## <a id='reqs'></a>Requirements

To install and use Platform Automation for PCF you need:

* The following tools installed on your local workstation:
  - User Authorization and Authentication CLI (UAAC)
  - om
  - p-automator
* If you want to generate a config based on an already running PCF, you will need a running Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) environment


##<a id='authenticate'></a> Authentication with Platform Automation for PCF

Most of the commands require authentication, which could be supplied by `--auth-file` or `-a` for short.

The format of the authentication file is as follows:
```yaml
opsman_url: domain.name.of.opsman
skip_ssl_validation: true
credentials:
  username:
  password:
  client-id:
  client-secret:
```

If you are using internal authentication, you can choose to provide `username & password` or `client-id & client-secret`

If you are using SAML authentication, you are required to provide `client-id & client-secret`

###<a id='generate'></a> Generate a New Client ID and Client Secret

1. `uaac target https://YOUR_OPSMANAGER/uaa`
1. `uaac token sso get` if using SAML or `uaac token owner get` if using internal auth. Specify the Client ID as `opsman` and leave Client Secret **blank**.
1. Generate a client ID and secret:

```
uaac client add -i
Client ID:  NEW_CLIENT_NAME
New client secret:  DESIRED_PASSWORD
Verify new client secret:  DESIRED_PASSWORD
