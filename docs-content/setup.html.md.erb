##<a id='authenticate'></a> Authenticating to Ops Blocks

Most of the commands require authentication, which could be supplied by `--auth-file` or `-a` for short.

The format of the authentication file is as follows:
```yaml
opsman_url: domain.name.of.opsman
skip_ssl_validation: true
credentials:
  username:
  password:
  client-id:
  client-secret:
```

If you are using internal authentication, you can choose to provide `username & password` or `client-id & client-secret`

If you are using SAML authentication, you are required to provide `client-id & client-secret`

1. `uaac token sso get` if using SAML or `uaac token owner get` if using internal auth. Specify the Client ID as `opsman` and leave Client Secret **blank**.
1. Generate a client ID and secret:
