## <a id='tasks'></a> Platform Automation for PCF Tasks
This document lists each Platform Automation for PCF task,
and provides information about their intentions, inputs, and outputs.

The tasks are presented, in their entirety,
as they are found in the product.

The docker image can be used to invoke the tasks in each task locally.
Use `--help` for more information.

### <a id='apply-changes'></a> apply-changes

Triggers an install on the Ops Manager described by the auth file.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'apply-changes' %>

### <a id='apply-director-changes'></a> apply-director-changes
`apply-changes` can also be used to trigger an install for just the BOSH Director
with the `--skip-deploy-products`/`-sdp` flag.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'apply-director-changes' %>

### <a id='configure-authentication'></a> configure-authentication
Configures Ops Manager with an internal userstore and admin user account.
See [configure-saml-authentication](#configure-saml-authentication) to configure an external SAML user store.
Note that this takes `auth.yml` with a `-c`/`--config` rather than the typical `--auth-file`.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-authentication' %>

### <a id='configure-director'></a> configure-director
Configures the BOSH Director with settings from a config file.
See [staged-director-config](#staged-director-config),
which can extract a config file.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-director' %>

<p class="note warning">
    <strong>NOTE:</strong>
    For GCP, if service account is used, the property associated_service_account has to be set explicitly in the iaas-configuration section.
</p>

### <a id='configure-product'></a> configure-product
Configures an individual, staged product with settings from a config file.

Not to be confused with Ops Manager's
built-in [import](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/restore-pcf-bbr.html#deploy-import),
which reads all deployed products and configurations from a single opaque file,
intended for import as part of backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.

See [staged-config](#staged-config),
which can extract a config file,
and [stage-product](#stage-product),
which can stage a product that's been uploaded.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-product' %>

### <a id='configure-saml-authentication'></a> configure-saml-authentication
Configures Ops Manager with an external SAML user store and admin user account.
See [configure-authentication](#configure-authentication) to configure an internal user store.

Because configuring an external auth source does not use the actual credentials,
it can't just draw them from `auth.yml` like `configure-authentication` does.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-saml-authentication' %>

Configuring SAML has two different auth flows for the UI and the task.
The UI will have a browser based login flow.
The CLI will require `client-id` and `client-secret` as it cannot do a browser login flow.

For more details on using SAML,
please refer to the Ops Manager documentation [here][saml-docs]

[saml-docs]:

### <a id='create-vm'></a> create-vm
Creates an unconfigured Ops Manager VM.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'create-vm' %>

This task requires a config file specific to the IaaS being deployed to.
Please see the [configuration](configuration.html#create-vm) page for more specific examples.

### <a id='delete-vm'></a> delete-vm
Deletes the Ops Manager VM instantiated by [create-vm](#create-vm).

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'delete-vm' %>

This task requires the state file generated [create-vm](#create-vm).

### <a id='export-installation'></a> export-installation
Exports an existing Ops Manager to a file.

This is the first part of the backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.
This task is used on a fully installed and healthy Ops Manager to export
settings to an upgraded version of Ops Manager.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'export-installation' %>
<%= partial 'export_installation_note' %>

### <a id='import-installation'></a> import-installation
Imports a previously exported installation to Ops Manager.

This is a part of the backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.
This task is used after an installation has been exported and a new Ops Manager
has been deployed, but before the new Ops Manager is configured.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'import-installation' %>

### <a id='staged-product'></a> staged-product
Stages an uploaded product.
(Unstaged products cannot be configured or installed.)
While this task takes a product path,
it does not upload the product.

In our example task,
this task is used immediately after `upload-product`.
The two tasks are usually used together,
though it is possible to invoke them separately.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'staged-config' %>

### <a id='staged-config'></a> staged-config
Downloads the configuration for a product from Ops Manager.

Not to be confused with Ops Manager's
built-in [export](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html#export),
which puts all deployed products and configurations into a single file,
intended for import as part of backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'staged-config' %>

### <a id='staged-director-config'></a> staged-director-config
Downloads configuration for the BOSH director from Ops Manager.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'staged-director-config' %>

### <a id='test'></a> test
An example task to ensure the assets and docker image are setup correctly in your concourse pipeline.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'test' %>

### <a id='upgrade-opsman'></a> upgrade-opsman
Upgrades an existing Ops Manager to a new given Ops Manager version

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'upgrade-opsman' %>

For more information about this task and how it works, see the [upgrade](upgrade.html) page.

### <a id='upload-and-stage-product'></a> upload-and-stage-product
Uploads and stages product to the Ops Manager specified in the config file.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'upload-and-stage-product' %>

### <a id='upload-stemcell'></a> upload-stemcell
Uploads a stemcell to Ops Manager.

Note that the filename of the stemcell must be exactly as downloaded from Pivnet.
Ops Manager parses this filename to determine the version and OS of the stemcell.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'upload-stemcell' %>
