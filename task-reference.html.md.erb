## <a id='tasks'></a> Platform Automation for PCF Tasks
This document lists each Platform Automation for PCF task,
and provides information about their intentions, inputs, and outputs.

The tasks are presented, in their entirety,
as they are found in the product.

The docker image can be used to invoke the tasks in each task locally.
Use `--help` for more information.

### <a id='apply-changes'></a> apply-changes

Triggers an install on the Ops Manager described by the auth file.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'apply-changes' %>

### <a id='apply-director-changes'></a> apply-director-changes
`apply-changes` can also be used to trigger an install for just the BOSH Director
with the `--skip-deploy-products`/`-sdp` flag.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'apply-director-changes' %>

### <a id='configure-authentication'></a> configure-authentication
Configures Ops Manager with an internal userstore and admin user account.
See [configure-saml-authentication](#configure-saml-authentication) to configure an external SAML user store.
Note that this takes `auth.yml` with a `-c`/`--config` rather than the typical `--auth-file`.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-authentication' %>

### <a id='configure-director'></a> configure-director
Configures the BOSH Director with settings from a config file.
See [staged-director-config](#staged-director-config),
which can extract a config file.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-director' %>

<p class="note warning">
    <strong>NOTE:</strong>
    For GCP, if service account is used, the property associated_service_account has to be set explicitly in the iaas-configuration section.
</p>

### <a id='configure-product'></a> configure-product
Configures an individual, staged product with settings from a config file.

Not to be confused with Ops Manager's
built-in [import](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/restore-pcf-bbr.html#deploy-import),
which reads all deployed products and configurations from a single opaque file,
intended for import as part of backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.

See [staged-config](#staged-config),
which can extract a config file,
and [stage-product](#stage-product),
which can stage a product that's been uploaded.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-product' %>

### <a id='configure-saml-authentication'></a> configure-saml-authentication
Configures Ops Manager with an external SAML user store and admin user account.
See [configure-authentication](#configure-authentication) to configure an internal user store.

Because configuring an external auth source does not use the actual credentials,
it can't just draw them from `auth.yml` like `configure-authentication` does.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'configure-saml-authentication' %>

Configuring SAML has two different auth flows for the UI and the task.
The UI will have a browser based login flow.
The CLI will require `client-id` and `client-secret` as it cannot do a browser login flow.

For more details on using SAML,
please refer to the [Ops Manager documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/opsguide/config-rbac.html#enable-saml)

### <a id='create-vm'></a> create-vm
Creates an unconfigured Ops Manager VM.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'create-vm' %>

This task requires a config file specific to the IaaS being deployed to.
Please see the [configuration](#opsman-config) page for more specific examples.

### <a id='delete-vm'></a> delete-vm
Deletes the Ops Manager VM instantiated by [create-vm](#create-vm).

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'delete-vm' %>

This task requires the [state file](#state) generated [create-vm](#create-vm).

### <a id='export-installation'></a> export-installation
Exports an existing Ops Manager to a file.

This is the first part of the backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.
This task is used on a fully installed and healthy Ops Manager to export
settings to an upgraded version of Ops Manager.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'export-installation' %>
<%= partial 'export_installation_note' %>

### <a id='import-installation'></a> import-installation
Imports a previously exported installation to Ops Manager.

This is a part of the backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.
This task is used after an installation has been exported and a new Ops Manager
has been deployed, but before the new Ops Manager is configured.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'import-installation' %>

### <a id='staged-product'></a> staged-product
Stages an uploaded product.
(Unstaged products cannot be configured or installed.)
While this task takes a product path,
it does not upload the product.

In our example task,
this task is used immediately after `upload-product`.
The two tasks are usually used together,
though it is possible to invoke them separately.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'staged-config' %>

### <a id='staged-config'></a> staged-config
Downloads the configuration for a product from Ops Manager.

Not to be confused with Ops Manager's
built-in [export](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html#export),
which puts all deployed products and configurations into a single file,
intended for import as part of backup/restore and upgrade lifecycle processes.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'staged-config' %>

### <a id='staged-director-config'></a> staged-director-config
Downloads configuration for the BOSH director from Ops Manager.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'staged-director-config' %>

The configuration is exported to the `generated-config` output.
It does not extract credentials from Ops Manager.
This is to ensure that credentials are never written to disk.
The credentials need to be provided from an external configuration when invoking [configure-director](#configure-director).

### <a id='test'></a> test
An example task to ensure the assets and docker image are setup correctly in your concourse pipeline.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'test' %>

### <a id='upgrade-opsman'></a> upgrade-opsman
Upgrades an existing Ops Manager to a new given Ops Manager version

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'upgrade-opsman' %>

For more information about this task and how it works, see the [upgrade](upgrade.html) page.

### <a id='upload-and-stage-product'></a> upload-and-stage-product
Uploads and stages product to the Ops Manager specified in the config file.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'upload-and-stage-product' %>

### <a id='upload-stemcell'></a> upload-stemcell
Uploads a stemcell to Ops Manager.

Note that the filename of the stemcell must be exactly as downloaded from Pivnet.
Ops Manager parses this filename to determine the version and OS of the stemcell.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'upload-stemcell' %>

## <a id="inputs"></a> Inputs
These are the inputs that can be provided to the tasks.
Each task can only take a specific set, indicated under the `inputs` property of the YAML.

### <a id="auth"></a> auth

The `auth` input for a task expects to have a `auth.yml` file.
This file contains properties for targeting and logging into the Ops Manager API.

There are two different authentication methods that Ops Manager supports.

#### basic authentication
The configuration for authentication has a dependency on username/password.
This configuration format matches the configuration for setting up authentication.
See the task for the [`configure-authentication`](#configure-authentication) for details.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'auth-configuration' %>

#### saml authentication
The configuration for authentication has a dependency on SAML.
This configuration format matches the configuration for setting up authentication.
See the task for the [`configure-saml-authentication`](#configure-saml-authentication) for details.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'saml-auth-configuration' %>

The `saml-configuration` properties configures the SAML provider.
The [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#setting-up-with-saml) has more information about the values

##### Getting the `client-id` and `client-secret`

Ops Manager will by preference use Client ID and Client Secret if provided.
To create a Client ID and Client Secret

1. `uaac target https://YOUR_OPSMANAGER/uaa`
1. `uaac token sso get` if using SAML or `uaac token owner get` if using internal auth. Specify the Client ID as `opsman` and leave Client Secret blank.
1. Generate a client ID and secret

```bash
uaac client add -i
Client ID:  NEW_CLIENT_NAME
New client secret:  DESIRED_PASSWORD
Verify new client secret:  DESIRED_PASSWORD
scope (list):  opsman.admin
authorized grant types (list):  client_credentials
authorities (list):  opsman.admin
access token validity (seconds):  43200
refresh token validity (seconds):  43200
redirect uri (list):
autoapprove (list):
signup redirect url (url):
```

### <a id="opsman-config"></a> opsman config
The config for an Ops Manager described IAAS specific information for creating the VM -- i.e. VM flavor (size), IP addresses

The `config` input for opsman task expects to have a `opsman.yml` file.
The configuration of the `opsman.yml` is IAAS specific.

Specific examples for each IaaS are as follows:

#### <a id='aws-configuration'></a> AWS
These required properties are adapted from the instructions outlined in
[Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on AWS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-aws-manual-config.html)

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'aws-configuration' %>

#### <a id='azure-configuration'></a> Azure
These required properties are adapted from the instructions outlined in
[Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Azure](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/azure.html)

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'azure-configuration' %>


#### <a id='gcp-configuration'></a> GCP
These required properties are adapted from the instructions outlined in
[Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/gcp-om-deploy.html)

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'gcp-configuration' %>


#### <a id='openstack-configuration'></a> Openstack
These required properties are adapted from the instructions outlined in
[Launching an Ops Manager Director Instance on Openstack](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/openstack-om-config.html)

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'openstack-configuration' %>


#### <a id='vsphere-configuration'></a> vSphere
These required properties are adapted from the instructions outlined in
[Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager to vSphere](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/deploying-vm.html)

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'vsphere-configuration' %>

### <a id="director-config"></a> director config
The config director will set the bosh tile (director) on Ops Manager.

The `config` input for a director task expects to have a `director.yml` file.
The configuration of the `director.yml` is IAAS specific for some properties -- i.e. networking.

There are two ways to build a director config.

1. Using an already deployed Ops Manager, you can extract the config using [staged-director-config](#staged-director-config).
2. Deploying a brand new Ops Manager requires more effort for a `director.yml`.
   The configuration of director is variables based on the features enabled.
   For brevity, this `director.yml` is a basic example for vsphere.
   
<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'director-configuration' %>

The IAAS specific configuration can be found in the Ops Manager API documentation.

Included below is a list of properties that can be set in the `director.yml`
and a link to the API documentation explaining any IAAS specific properties.

* `az-configuration` - a list of availability zones [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-availability-zones-experimental)
* `iaas-configuration` - configuration for the bosh IAAS CPI [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-director-and-iaas-properties-experimental)
* `network-assignment` - the network the bosh director is deployed to [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-network-and-availability-zone-assignments)
* `networks-configuration` - a list of named networks [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-networks-experimental)
* `director-configuration` - properties for the bosh director [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-director-and-iaas-properties-experimental)
* `resource-configuration` - IAAS VM flavor for the bosh director [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#configuring-resources-for-a-job)
* `security-configuration` - security properties for the bosh director [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-director-and-iaas-properties-experimental)
* `syslog-configuration` - configure the syslog sinks for the bosh director [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-director-and-iaas-properties-experimental)

### <a id="product-config"></a> product config
There are two ways to build a product config.

1. Using an already deployed product (tile), you can extract the config using [staged-config](#staged-config).
1. Use an example and fill in the values based on the meta information from the tile.
For brevity, this `product.yml` is a basic example for `healthwatch`.
  
<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'product-configuration' %>

Included below is a list of properties that can be set in the `product.yml`
and a link to the API documentation explaining the properties.

* `product-properties` - properties for the tile [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#updating-a-selector-property)
* `network-properties` - a list of named networks to deploy the VMs to [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#configuring-networks-and-azs)
* `resource-config` - for the jobs of the tile [Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/opsman-api/#configuring-resources-for-a-job)

### <a id="state"></a> state
This file contains that meta-information needed to manage the Ops Manager VM.
The `state` input for a opsman VM task expects to have a `state.yml` file.

<%= yield_for_code_snippet from: 'pivotal-cf/platform-automation', at: 'state' %>

The file contains two properties:

1. `iaas` is the iaas the ops manager vm is hosted on. (`gcp`, `vsphere`, `aws`, `azure`, `openstack`)
2. `vm_id` is the VM unique identifier for the VM. For some IAAS, the vm ID is the VM name.

### <a id="opsman-image"></a> opsman image
This file is an [artifact from Pivnet](https://network.pivotal.io/products/ops-manager), which contains the VM image on an IAAS.
For vsphere and openstack, it is a full disk image.
For AWS, GCP, and Azure, it is the YAML file of the image locations.

An example on how to pull the AWS image resource using the [Pivnet Concourse Resource](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivnet-resource).

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: pivnet
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: pivotalcf/pivnet-resource
    tag: latest-final
resources:
- name: opsman-image
  type: pivnet
  source:
    api_token: ((pivnet_token))
    product_slug: ops-manager
    product_version: 2.*
    sort_by: semver
jobs:
- name: get-the-resource
  plan:
  - get: opsman-image
    params:
      globs: ["*AWS*.yml"]
```

### <a id="installation"></a> installation
The file contains the information to restore an Ops Manager VM.
The `installation` input for a opsman VM task expects to have a `installation.zip` file.

This file can be exported from an Ops Manager VM using the [export-installation](#export-installation).
This file can be imported to an Ops Manager VM using the [import-installation](#import-installation).

<p class="note warning">
    <strong>NOTE:</strong>
    This file cannot be manually created. It is a file that must be generated via the export function of Ops Manager.
</p>

### <a id="stemcell"></a> stemcell
This `stemcell` input requires the stemcell tarball (`.tgz`) as downloaded from Pivnet.
It must be in the original filename as that is used by Ops Manager to parse metadata.
The filename could look like `bosh-stemcell-3541.48-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz`.

<p class="note warning">
    <strong>NOTE:</strong>
    This file cannot be manually created. It is a file that must retrieved from Pivnet.
</p>

An example on how to pull the vSphere stemcell using the [Pivnet Concourse Resource](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivnet-resource).

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: pivnet
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: pivotalcf/pivnet-resource
    tag: latest-final
resources:
- name: stemcell
  type: pivnet
  source:
    api_token: ((pivnet_token))
    product_slug: stemcells

    sort_by: semver
jobs:
- name: get-the-resource
  plan:
  - get: stemcell
    params:
      globs: ["*vsphere*.tgz"]
```
 
### <a id="product"></a> product
The `product` input requires a single tile file (`.pivotal`) as downloaded from Pivnet.

An example on how to pull the PAS tile using the [Pivnet Concourse Resource](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivnet-resource).

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: pivnet
