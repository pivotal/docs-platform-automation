Platform Automation for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
is a set of commands that wrap and extend [om](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om),
a command-line interface to Ops Manager.

Platform Automation for PCF uses `om`,
(and by extension, the Ops Manager API)
to enable command-line interaction with Ops Manager,
a dashboard for installing, configuring, and updating software products on PCF.
Platform Automation for PCF comes bundled with Concourse tasks
that demonstrate how to use these commands
in a containerized Continuous Integration (CI) system,
and a reference pipeline
showing one possible configuration of these tasks.

To learn more about Ops Manager,
see [Understanding the Ops Manager Interface](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-interface.html).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview
Platform Automation for PCF commands enable PCF operators
to script and automate Ops Manager actions.
Platform Automation for PCF commands are:

* **Legible**: They use configuration from
human-readable YAML files,
which users can edit,
and manage in version control.

* **Modular**: Each command has defined inputs and outputs
and performs a granular action.
They're designed to work together
to enable many different workflows.
Users can build systems to make changes to all their products together,
or one at a time.
Users can extract configuration from one environment
and use it as a template for configuring many more.

* **Built for Automation** Commands are idempotent,
so re-running them in a CI won't break builds.
They read and write config from files,
which machines can easily pass around.
They're available in a Docker container,
which makes the tools easy to use in CI.

* **Not Comprehensive**: Workflows that use Platform Automation for PCF
typically also contain `om` commands, custom tasks,
and even interactions with the Ops Manager user interface.
Platform Automation for PCF are tools to use alongside other tools,
rather than a comprehensive solution.

The following table lists all Platform Automation for PCF commands. See the [Command and Task Reference][command-reference] for a complete explanation of each:

| Command | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| install-opsman | Install Opsman VM on supported IAAS (Currently only vSphere)
| configure-authentication |  configures Ops Manager with an internal userstore and admin user account
| configure-saml-authentication |  configures Ops Manager with SAML authentication
| configure-director |  configures the director
| upload-product |  uploads a given product to the Ops Manager targeted
| stage-product |  stages a given product to the Ops Manager targeted
| configure-product |  configures a staged product
| upload-stemcell |  uploads a given stemcell to the Ops Manager targeted
| apply-changes |  triggers an install on the Ops Manager targeted
| export-installation |  exports an existing Ops Manager installation to a specified file

## <a id='pipelines'></a> Using Platform Automation for PCF in Pipelines
Platform Automation for PCF comes bundled with Concourse [tasks][concourse-task-definition].
These task files wrap one or two Platform Automation for PCF commands
and their input and output definitions
in the YAML format that Concourse uses to build pipelines.
If you use a different CI/CD platform, you can use these Concourse files as examples of the inputs, outputs, and arguments used in each step in the workflow.

The [Command Reference][command-reference] topic discusses these example tasks further.
