### Bug Fixes
- [`pending-changes`][pending-changes] would always fail if installation incomplete, product unconfigured, or stemcell missing
   regardless of whether `ALLOW_PENDING_CHANGES` was true or false.
   This has been fixed so that the implied and intended behavior is reflected in the ouput of the command.
   The also allows [`stage-configure-apply`][stage-configure-apply] to actually work when installing new tiles.
