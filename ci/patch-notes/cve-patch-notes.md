### Bug Fixes
- The "bug fixes" for collections in `om` 6.1.2+
  were causing unexpected issues in some tiles.
  The collection work has been reverted
  to its original functionality.
- [`pending-changes`][pending-changes] and [`stage-configure-apply`][stage-configure-apply]
  would always fail if a product is unconfigured, new, or missing a stemcell,
  regardless of whether `ALLOW_PENDING_CHANGES` was set.
  This has been fixed. `pending-changes` will only fail if `ALLOW_PENDING_CHANGES: true`.
