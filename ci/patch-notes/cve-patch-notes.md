!!! note "Updates to CLI versions"
    We've now updated our list of CLI versions.
    It includes the supported IAAS CLIs.

### Bug Fixes
- Do to a release packaging issue,
  the previous patch version had issues invoking `openstack` CLI.
  This release ensures this has been fixed.
  We've also added further release testing to ensure it doesn't happen again.
