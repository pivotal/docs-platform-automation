### Bug Fixes
- The `om` CLI has been explicitly requesting `opaque` tokens.
  This was an unintentional and incidental change;
  previously it used `jwt`,
  the token format UAA provides by default.
  The `opaque` token may have been contributing to
  a hard-to-reproduce issue in a customer environment,
  so we're explicitly switching back to `jwt` tokens.
- CVE update to container image.
  Resolves [USN 5021-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5021-1),
  an issue related to libcurl.
