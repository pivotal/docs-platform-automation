- [`stage-product`][stage-product] and [`stage-configure-apply`][stage-configure-apply] 
  will now accept `latest` as the `product-version`
  if you are providing a `CONFIG_FILE`/`STAGE_PRODUCT_CONFIG_FILE`.
  This fixes an issue that required users to update their config file
  every time a new version was available on Ops Manager.
- [`stage-configure-apply`][stage-configure-apply] will now treat the `product` input
  as truly optional if `CONFIG_FILE` is provided.
