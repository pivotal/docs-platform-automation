# Maintainer's Guide Notes

It is our intention to centralize our notes
about how we maintain and release Platform Automation Toolkit here.
Keeping in mind that this is a _public repository_,
so secrets and some details will necessarily be stored
in other systems,
though their existence and location should be documented here.

Many of these links require VMware VPN access or other credentials;
these instructions are public as an implementation detail,
and are not intended to be useful to the public.

## CVEs and Patching Steps

[Platform Automation Toolkit](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=Platform%20Automation%20Toolkit) distributes three artifacts.
This includes a zip file of Concourse YAML tasks and two tarballs of container images, one smaller, vsphere-only image and one larger
image that can be used on all platforms.

The container image uses Ubuntu and its package manager to install most dependencies.
VMware (through Pivotal) has a support license, which provides timely security updates to these packages.

This document contains instructions of how the container is updated and released for security purposes:

1. [Verifying the Patch](#verifying-the-patch)
1. [Updating Patch Notes](#updating-patch-notes)
1. [Release the Patch](#release-the-patch)

### Verifying the Patch
If the container image does not have the correct version, the pipeline needs to be triggered to pull in the latest package.
1. Trigger the [`build-packages-image`](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/build-packages-image/builds/latest) job to start the container build process, which installs the latest packages.
   > **NOTE:** When this job finishes, it will trigger downstream `build-binaries-image-combined` and subsequent jobs.
1. When the `build-binaries-image-combined` is finished from its upstream trigger, reinspect the image receipt to confirm it was updated.

### Updating Patch Notes
1. Update the release notes with features, bug fixes, and CVEs.
   The release notes are found in: [`docs-platform-automation/ci/patch-notes`](https://github.com/pivotal/docs-platform-automation/tree/develop/ci/patch-notes)
   
   > **NOTE:** Release notes are _required_ for every release. If patch notes are omitted, CI will fail `create-release-notes-for-patch` job in `update-vX.X` jobs.

   > **NOTE:** Any release notes in `cve-patch-notes.md` will be applied to _all supported versions_.<br />
   To add bug fixes to a specific version, edit the `X.X-patch-notes.md` file instead. 
   
    ex.
   ```
   ### Bug Fixes
   - CVE update to container image.
   Resolves [USN 5133-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5133-1),
   an issue related to ICU crashing
   ```
   If needed, see [Platform Automation Toolkit v5.0 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform-automation/v5.0/release-notes.html) for more examples.
1. Commit and push the changes

### Release the Patch
1. In the `ci` pipeline, make sure the build has passed all jobs that are not `promote-to-final`.
1. In the `patch-bump` group, trigger the [`bump-previous-versions-trigger`](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/bump-previous-versions-trigger/builds/29) job. The `get`s should have the same version as the `put`s from the [`build-binaries-image-combined`](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/build-binaries-image-combined/builds/latest) job.

   This will trigger the patch process.
   To validate the appropriate CVEs were updated in supported versions,
   wait until the `update-vX.X` job has completed,
   then download the `image-receipt-X.X.X` from AWS S3
   (this link is also be available in the release notes for each version).

   >**NOTE:** if any `update-vX.X` job fails during uploading to TanzuNet,
   delete the release and any files that were uploaded manually on the UI.
   Then re-run the job. The job will not re-generate release notes.
   However, the release date of the job will be whatever the date of the 
   first run for the patch was. The task that generates the release notes 
   for each minor/major version is called `create-release-notes-for-patch`.

1. The `update-vX.X` job pushes each patch release & its artifacts directly to S3 to be uploaded to RMT manually.
 - Eventually this will be done via automation, however it is a manual process as of the TanzuNet to RMT cutover.

### If Needed, Updating the Release Notes Manually
There is an easy (manual) way to undo the docs created for CVE patching.
This could be due to:
- failure to update the `cve-patch-notes.md` before creating patch,
  so the release notes are wrong
- there were additional bug fixes that were left out
- some other reason

The following steps are a manual process to "revert"
the generated release notes and re-create them manually.<br />
**NOTE:** if due to a failed build, you _must_ stop before the last step.
CI will fail if the version already exists.
1. `git clone https://github.com/pivotal/docs-platform-automation` 
1. `git submodule update --init --recursive` in `docs-platform-automation`
1. Make a list of each version that will be patched in x.x.x format
  (this is the most recent version of each supported minor).
1. Manually remove the entirety of each supported minor section from `docs-platform-automation/docs/release-notes.html.md.erb` & its respective branch:
   * `v5.2` [release notes](https://github.com/pivotal/docs-platform-automation/blob/v5.2/docs/release-notes.html.md.erb)
   * `v5.1` [release notes](https://github.com/pivotal/docs-platform-automation/blob/migration-v5.1/docs/release-notes.html.md.erb)
1. commit and push
1. run the following command to remove those sections from the previous branches

   ```bash
   go run docs-platform-automation/ci/scripts/generate-release-notes/generate-release-notes.go \
   --docs-dir docs-platform-automation/docs
   ```

1. If there are bug fixes for specific versions, do not create release notes for all versions (a.),
   but instead create the release notes for each version individually(b.).
   
   **a.** all versions
   
     with an updated `docs-platform-automation/ci/patch-notes/cve-patch-notes.md`,
     and the list of each supported full patch version,
     run the following command:

     ```bash
     go run docs-platform-automation/ci/scripts/generate-release-notes/generate-release-notes.go \
     --docs-dir docs-platform-automation/docs \
     --cve-patch-notes-path /path/to/docs-platform-automation/ci/cve-patch-notes/cve-patch-notes.md \
     --cve-patch-versions x.x.x \
     --cve-patch-versions y.y.y \
     --cve-patch-versions z.z.z
     ```

     This command will generate a new section for each patch version provided
     with the current date and the data written in `cve-patch-notes.md`.
     The changes are pushed, and develop is re-checked out,
     so no more manual work is necessary.

   **b.** individual versions
   
     with an updated `docs-platform-automation/ci/patch-notes/cve-patch-notes.md`,
     and an updated `docs-platform-automation/ci/patch-notes/X.X-patch-notes.md`,
     and a _specific_ patch version,
     run the following command:
     
     ```bash
     go run docs-platform-automation/ci/scripts/generate-release-notes/generate-release-notes.go \
     --docs-dir /path/to/docs-platform-automation \
     --cve-patch-notes-path /path/to/docs-platform-automation/ci/cve-patch-notes/cve-patch-notes.md \
     --cve-patch-notes-path /path/to/docs-platform-automation/ci/cve-patch-notes/X.X-patch-notes.md \
     --cve-patch-versions X.X.X 
     ```

### What if I Need to Add Release Notes for a Feature or Breaking Change to a Patch Version?
Don't. Revert any such changes to those patch versions.

Platform Automation is strictly [semvered](https://semver.org/)
with an API defined in our [docs](https://docs-pcf-staging.tas.vmware.com/platform-automation/develop/compatibility-and-versioning.html#semantic-versioning).

Patching of this product should _never_ include features or breaking changes.

In the event that we _do_ release such changes
despite our best intentions and efforts,
we should release a subsequent patch that documents and reverts the changes.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è New OSSPI Process to obtain the ODP & OSL files from OSM ‚≠êÔ∏è
When you commit your change to the Platform Automation Toolkit, propagate your committed change through the `ci` pipeline **until** you are ready to start the [bump-previous-versions-trigger job](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/bump-previous-versions-trigger/builds/latest), right before you plan to release the integrated change. The current process is very manual unfortunately, however, our instructions shall guide you through the process!

### When to do this process‚ùì
If your changes have altered the packages being used in the [Platform Automation Image](dev.registry.pivotal.io/platform-automation/platform-automation-image) or in the [om-cli](), then you more than likely have to perform the OSM process. 
*  If you see changes to any go.mod files or any updates to the image itself, you should perform OSM. 
* ü§î If you're unsure, it never hurts to run through our OSM process as it will report no changes if there are actually none.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è There should not regularly be changes to packages in Platform Automation! Any changes go to the Docker images go into _all_ released versions of Platform Automation Toolkit.

### BOSS Director üé¨
To begin actually getting a product into OSM, the new product release versions must first be uploaded to [BOSS Director](https://vmware-lme.my.salesforce.com/) ([wiki](https://confluence.eng.vmware.com/display/VESVLM/BOSS+Director+Home)). Unfortunately, a manager with elevated privileges must submit these on our team's behalf. 

Currently our team's contact for this is [Mark Arroyo](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/D04LUAQGFU4). To help Mark make the entries in BOSS Director, you must provide him the new version numbers of your release. You will need a version number for all 3 of our releases:
* `5.1.x`
* `5.0.x`
* `4.4.x`
 
If you can't determine these, look in the `get: version` task in the following jobs:
* [update-v4.4](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/update-v4.4/builds/latest)
* [update-v5.0](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/update-v5.0/builds/latest)
* [update-v5.1](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/update-v5.1/builds/latest)

Your versions will be the next in sequence from the highest version seen in that task, usually the next in sequence from the current latest releases.

Approval can take a few days, it's on the [#bossd-assist](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C01KLN7HZ7G) team from here until they add it.

### Make the new 4.4.x Release in OSM üñ•Ô∏è

After the new releases are confirmed by the BOSS Director, log into [OSM](https://osm.eng.vmware.com/oss/#/) and click `Add a Version / Clone Packages`. When you're in this view, we're going to enter the Platform Automation Toolkit information like so:

* **OSM Release Name** -> `platform-automation`
* **New Version / Clone to Version** -> `4.4.x`
* **First Milestone Release** -> `GA`
* **Release Manager** -> `arroyoma@vmware.com`
* **Product Manager** -> `arroyoma@vmware.com`
* **Engineering Manager** -> `arroyoma@vmware.com`
* **CC List** -> `Anyone else you want to involve in this process`
* **Product License Type** -> `VMW_Proprietary`
* **Distributed with VMware Release Name** -> `Platform Automation Toolkit`
* **Distributed with VMware Release Version** -> `4.4.x`
* **Requested Open Source License Date** -> `Today's date + 2 weeks, at least`
* NOTES:
  * `4.4.x` should be the actual new 4.4.x series version. 
  * We will clone `5.0.x` & `5.1.x` later.
  * There is no VP or OSPO contact to add in this form.
  * Do not check the box for  "This release is not distributed as a standalone release".
  * "Distributed with VMware Release Version" will only show what's in the BOSS Director.
  * "Requested Open Source License Date" needs 2 weeks of leeway, for reasons.

Once the form is completed, you should be able to click the `Submit Request` button, so do it!

### "Automated" OSSPI Tool Time üõ†Ô∏è
Run the [OSM Job](https://runway-ci.eng.vmware.com/teams/ppe-platform-automation/pipelines/osspi/jobs/osm/builds/latest).

The scans are going to run PPE's integrated versions of the `run-osspi-source` & `run-osspi-docker` jobs based on [Tony Wong's norsk-to-osspi tasks](https://gitlab.eng.vmware.com/source-insight-tooling/norsk-to-osspi/-/tree/main/tasks/osspi). We're scanning the `om-cli` & our Platform Automation Image for changes to report to OSM for compliance. The results will upload using [Ryan Hall's](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/DUWBJE4RL) API key for the OSM platform. Once the jobs are all green in the OSSPI Pipeline, validate the scans are in OSM.

* Go to [OSM Releases](https://osm.eng.vmware.com/oss/#/release).
* Filter by **Release Name** of `platform-automation`.
* Click on the `4.4.x` release version you uploaded for.
* You should see a link to `View all open source packages in this release`

From here, it's more waiting, it's on our [#OSM Team](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C41ELJFA5) to confirm the uploaded results. The emails added to the release when you created should get updates on the analysis progress. Resolve any issues they report to advance the process, you will likely just need to point them in the direction of any package sources they can't find.

If everything is approved at this point, you should see all the release's packages in an `APPROVED` and/or `RESOLVED` state. In the OSM Release page, there will be links to get what we need, OSL & ODP. 

### Download the new 4.4.x OSL
* Go to [OSM Releases](https://osm.eng.vmware.com/oss/#/release).
* Filter by **Release Name** of `platform-automation`.
* Click on the `4.4.x` release version you uploaded for. 
* Scroll down to the `License File Review` section.
* Click the link to `View LFR Ticket`.
* In the new view, you should see the OSL <open_source_license_*_GA.txt> file in the `Distributed OSLs` section. Download it and save it to upload it to S3.

### Download the new 4.4.x ODP
* Go to [OSM Releases](https://osm.eng.vmware.com/oss/#/release).
* Filter by **Release Name** of `platform-automation`.
* Click on the `4.4.x` release version you uploaded for.
* Click on the `ODP` tab.
* Click the button for `Generate ODP`. This will take a moment.
* Once the ODP is ready, you should see a link in the `ODP Image` section of this view.
* Download the ODP, and save it to upload it to S3.

### Upload the OSL & ODP to S3 ü™£

* Pull the platform-automation-deployments repository and `cd platform-automation-deploments/concourse-credhub`.
* Gather the S3 credentials for `s3://platform-automation-release-candidate` and export them to utilize the `aws s3 cli` for uploading OSL & ODP. Once you have the credentials in place, you will use the cli to move the files to their respective bucket locations.:
   * `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(credhub get -q -n /concourse/main/s3_access_key_id)`
   * `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(credhub get -q -n /concourse/main/s3_secret_access_key)`
* **OSL**:
  * The [OSL Resource](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/resources/osl) is looking for a file called `open_source_license_Platform_Automation_Toolkit_for_VMware_Tanzu_5.1.2_GA.txt`, rename your OSL file to this.
  * `mv ~/path/to/downloaded/OSL.txt ~/open_source_license_Platform_Automation_Toolkit_for_VMware_Tanzu_5.1.2_GA.txt`
  * `aws s3 cp ~/open_source_license_Platform_Automation_Toolkit_for_VMware_Tanzu_5.1.2_GA.txt s3://platform-automation-release-candidate`
* **ODP**:
  * The [ODP Resource](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/resources/osl) is looking for a file called `VMware-Tanzu-platform-automation-toolkit-5.1.2-ODP.tar.gz`, rename your ODP file to this.
  * `mv ~/path/to/downloaded/ODP.zip ~/VMware-Tanzu-platform-automation-toolkit-5.1.2-ODP.tar.gz`
  * `aws s3 cp ~/VMware-Tanzu-platform-automation-toolkit-5.1.2-ODP.tar.gz s3://platform-automation-release-candidate`
  * This file is > 1GB so the upload will take a moment.

### Clone the OSM Releases for 5.0.x & 5.1.x
Now that the compliance files are in the right buckets for our CI, we need to clone the `4.4.x` release in OSM for our other versions.

Log into [OSM](https://osm.eng.vmware.com/oss/#/) and click `Add a Version / Clone Packages`. When you're in this view, we're going to clone the Platform Automation Toolkit. In the "Clone Packages / Release References" box, select the following:

* **From Release Name** -> `platform-automation`
* **From Release Version** -> `4.4.x`

You will need to add the remaining information:

* **OSM Release Name** -> `platform-automation`
* **New Version / Clone to Version** -> `5.0.x`/`5.1.x`
* **First Milestone Release** -> `GA`
* **CC List** -> `Anyone else you want to involve in this process`
* **Distributed with VMware Release Name** -> `Platform Automation Toolkit`
* **Distributed with VMware Release Version** -> `5.0.x`/`5.1.x`
* **Requested Open Source License Date** -> `Today's date + 2 weeks, at least`
* NOTES:
  * You will need to do this twice, once for the `5.0.x` version and once for the `5.1.x` version.
  * `5.0.x`/`5.1.x` should be the actual new 4.4.x series version. 
  * There is no VP or OSPO contact to add in this form.
  * Do not check the box for  "This release is not distributed as a standalone release".
  * "Distributed with VMware Release Version" will only show what's in the BOSS Director. If you don't see the `5.0.x`/`5.1.x` release versions then the BOSS Director has not created them yet.
  * "Requested Open Source License Date" needs 2 weeks of leeway, for reasons.


### Resume the Release Process
With OSL & ODP where they need to be, you may now run the [bump-previous-versions-trigger](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/bump-previous-versions-trigger/builds/latest) job. Once the job completes, it will automatically start the following update jobs:

* [update-v4.4](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/update-v4.4/builds/latest)
* [update-v5.0](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/update-v5.0/builds/latest)
* [update-v5.1](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/update-v5.1/builds/latest)

If these jobs successfully pull the OSL & ODP resources, then you have succesfully performed the OSSPI Process üéâ


#### BUILD.txt and INSTALL.txt
If any dependencies require SBR,
add the following 2 files into the generated folder
before zipping the directory:

BUILD.txt
```
# install build dependencies
apt-get update && apt-get install build-essential fakeroot devscripts equivs

# unpackage and enter source code directory
tar -xzf <package-version>.tar.gz
cd <package-version>
tar -xf <package-version>.tar.xz

# if there is a <package-version>.debian.tar.xz
tar -xf <package-version>.debian.tar.xz
mv debian <package-version>

# once you have the debian directory, move inside
cd <package-version>

# apply any necessary patches
patch -p1 < SomePackagePatch.patch

# install package dependencies and create package
mk-build-deps

# move final package
mv <package-version>.deb ../..
```

INSTALL.txt
```
# assuming you have followed the BUILD.txt instruction to build
dpkg -i <package-version>.deb
```

## [Reference Pipeline](https://github.com/pivotal/docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config) Maintenance
The reference pipeline (not "example pipeline") from our [docs](https://docs-pcf-staging.tas.vmware.com/platform-automation/develop/pipelines/multiple-products.html)
is fully tested in [CI](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/reference-pipeline).
It is currently deployed on GCP,
though history of the repo will reveal that it was previously deployed on vSphere.

When making any new features for the product, the reference pipeline should be run,
and should be completely green before release. The [`additional-task-testing`](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/additional-task-testing/builds/170) job
relies on the reference-pipeline being successfully up and deployed.
This ci pipeline task _is explicitly_ a release blocker, while the reference pipeline is not explicitly a blocker.

The reference pipeline exists in the [docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config](https://github.com/pivotal/docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config) repo.
The repo is organized to represent a [multi-foundation configuration structure](https://docs-pcf-staging.tas.vmware.com/platform-automation/develop/pipeline-design/configuration-management-strategies.html#multiple-foundations-with-one-repository).
The reference pipeline is the `sandbox` directory in that repo. 

`auth.yml` and `env.yml` are shared between foundations.
Values for these files are set on a per-foundation/per-pipeline basis,
and the values are stored in Credhub.

Terraform files for the reference pipeline can be found in the [deployments](https://github.com/pivotal/platform-automation-deployments) repo.
The deployments repo also contains all relevant terraform/vars for all of our ci test pipelines.
The reference pipeline is saved in the `reference-gcp` directory.

### Recreating the reference pipeline

If the reference pipeline needs to recreated for any reason,
the following steps must be executed.

1. Run the [`reference-gcp-delete-infrastructure`](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/reference-gcp-delete-infrastructure) job.
   This job will attempt to, in the following order: 
   * delete the deployment
   * delete the terraform infrastructure
   * use [leftovers](https://github.com/genevieve/leftovers) to cleanup all extra resources with the `reference-gcp` tag

1. Make sure you are using Terraform 1.0+
2. Recreate the terraform infrastructure using the instructions in platform-automation-deployments [`reference-gcp` README](https://github.com/pivotal/platform-automation-deployments/blob/main/reference-gcp/README.md)
3. Commit the terraform.tfstate
4. (Optional) `platform-automation-deployments/reference-gcp/terraform-outputs.json` is present for convenience, and was crafted by executing the following commands inside the `reference-gcp` directory:

   ```
   terraform output -json stable_config_opsmanager | jq -r > terraform-outputs.json
   terraform output -json stable_config_pas | jq -r >> terraform-outputs.json
   terraform output -json stable_config_pks | jq -r >> terraform-outputs.json
   ```
       
1. Recreate the vars files for the reference pipeline by extracting the terraform vars:
   Vars files for the reference pipeline can be found in `docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config/foundations/sandbox/vars`.
   To update these files, from inside the platform-automation-deployments/reference-gcp directory:

   **DO NOT COMMIT THESE UPDATES YET!**

   ```bash
   terraform output -json stable_config_opsmanager | jq -r | jq > ~/workspace/docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config/foundations/sandbox/vars/director.yml
   terraform output -json stable_config_pas | jq -r | jq  > ~/workspace/docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config/foundations/sandbox/vars/tas.yml
   terraform output -json stable_config_pks | jq -r | jq  > ~/workspace/docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config/foundations/sandbox/vars/pks.yml
   ```
   	> FYI... YAML is a superset of JSON. This means that any JSON is a valid YAML file!  The om tooling only parses files with var files with `.yml|.yaml` extensions so that's why we're using .yml extensions on the files we're writing JSON output to.


1. The terraform outputs contain secrets.
 
   **_REMEMBER_**: `docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config` is a public repo.

   We will need to strip out any secrets before committing our updated vars files.
   
   Update the following values in [`export.yml`](https://github.com/pivotal/platform-automation-deployments/blob/main/concourse-credhub/export.yml) using values from the terraform outputs:

   * /concourse/main/reference-pipeline/service_account_key
   * /concourse/main/reference-pipeline/ops_manager_service_account_key
   * /concourse/main/reference-pipeline/ssl_certificate
   * /concourse/main/reference-pipeline/ssl_private_key
   * /concourse/main/reference-pipeline/ops_manager_ssh_private_key
   * /concourse/main/reference-pipeline/ops_manager_ssh_public_key
   * /concourse/main/vsphere_private_ssh_key (should be updated with the same value as `ops_manager_ssh_private_key`)
     
   Also update any other secrets from the terraform outputs in the `export.yml`

   Remove the above secrets from `vars/director.yml`, `vars/tas.yml`, `vars/pks.yml`

   We also needed to delete the `ops_manager_dns` secret from `foundations/sandbox/vars/director.yml` because we need the prepare-tasks-with-secrets task to pull it's value from Credhub.

	> Secrets in om's env.yml file are a special case and need to be stored in Credhub and passed as Environment Variables in the task.yml (ops_manager_dns should already be in export.yml and doesn't need to be updated)

1. To store/edit values in Credhub, export the vars from the `.envrc` in `platform-automation-deployments/concourse-credhub`.
   You can now access Credhub as normal. Run:
    ```bash
    credhub import -f export.yml
    ```

1. Commit all changes
1. Replace the [`state-sandbox.yml`](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/ref-pipeline-state?region=us-west-2&tab=objects) stored in s3 with an empty file of the same name.
   ```
   touch state-sandbox.yml
   aws --profile=platform-automation s3 cp state-sandbox.yml s3://ref-pipeline-state/state-sandbox.yml
   ```
   
1. Delete the `reference-pipeline`: (this is done to reset any pipeline triggers)
   ```
   fly -t ci dp -p reference-pipeline
   ```

1. Refly the reference pipeline
   ```
   cd ~/workspace/docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config
   ./scripts/update-reference-pipeline.sh
   ```
   
1. Rerun the reference-pipeline from the beginning.
   The pipeline triggers should function as normal,
   and you should expect a new reference pipeline env in approximately 2-3 hours.
   We recommend checking in on the pipeline every now and then
   to validate it is running smoothly.
    

#### Create a cluster

We need to create a PKS cluster because we test the `backup-tkgi` task in [additional task testing.](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/additional-task-testing/builds/185)

**_This has been automated by the [create-pks-cluster-in-reference-pipeline task](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci/jobs/create-pks-cluster-in-reference-pipeline/builds/24)._**

The task will perform the following steps, documented here for the purposes of manual creation should the need arise:

1. Get the Private SSH key for the Ops Manager VM, this will be available in the terraform outputs. 
1. Create a user that will be the owner of the cluster.
    ```bash
    ssh -i /tmp/key ubuntu@opsmanager.reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com
    uaac target https://api.pks.reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com:8443 --ca-cert /tmp/releng_ca_certificate
    uaac token client get admin -s <uaa admin management secret>
    uaac user add platform-automation --emails platform-automation@example.com -p <super-secret-password>
    uaac member add pks.clusters.admin platform-automation
    ```

1. Create a PKS cluster
    ```bash
    ./pks login -a api.pks.reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com -u platform-automation -p <super-secret-password> --skip-ssl-verification
    ./pks create-cluster my-cluster --plan small --external-hostname example.hostname
    watch ./pks cluster my-cluster # eventually this will have a status of "complete"
    ```

1. Wait up to 30 minutes for the cluster to be created.

#### Create the Reference Pipeline SSL certificate
The [Paving](https://github.com/pivotal/paving) terraform recipes require a SSL certificate as input for the HTTPS load balancer that sits in front of the Foundation's router instances.

GCP Load Balancers [do not support](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35904953) (as of July, 2023) the 3072 bit private key length of Certificates generated by bosh, so we are using Credhub to generate our certificate.

1. Target the Platform Automation Concourse Credhub instance.
  * `cd ~/workspace/platform-automation-deployments/concourse-credhub`
1. Grab a copy of the [Releng CA Certificate](https://3.basecamp.com/4957863/buckets/20459415/documents/4860240754) and upload it to to Credhub so we can sign our new certificate with it.
  * `credhub set -t certificate -n '/concourse/main/reference-pipeline/ca_certificate' -c /tmp/releng.crt -p /tmp/releng.key`
1. Generate a 2048 bit key signed by our CA with the correct SANs for our reference foundation.

  ```
  credhub generate -t certificate --ca /concourse/main/reference-pipeline/ca_certificate -n /test/reference-certificate -d 720 \
  -k 2048 -o VMware -u PPE -i "San Francisco" -s California -y US \
  -c reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com \
  -a "*.sys.reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com" \
  -a "*.apps.reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com" \
  -a "*.pks.reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com" \
  -a "*.reference-gcp.gcp.platform-automation.cf-app.com"
  ```
1. Save the new certificate and private key.
  * `platform-automation-deployments/reference-gcp/terraform.tfvars`
  * `platform-automation-deployments/concourse-credhub/export.yml`
1. Update the Credhub instance with new values.
  * `credhub import -f export.yml`

#### Rotating the Reference Pipeline Environment's certificates

In our pipeline for the reference pipeline, there is a job called "[expiring-certificates](https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/reference-pipeline/jobs/expiring-certificates/builds/latest)". This job will check the expiration dates for all of the certificates that the environment's ops manager knows about.

It does this by using `om --env env/foundations/config/env.yml expiring-certificates --expires-within 2m`.

If the job fails, then you'll need to read the error message which will have a description of the certificate that is expiring. It will also have a link to documentation on how to rotate the certificate. However, that link is out of date as of 2024-03-06. Here is an up to date version of the documentation: [Rotating CAs and leaf certificates using the Tanzu Operations Manager API](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html).

## Docs Maintenance
Most of the docs are found here in this `docs-platform-automation` repo.
Locked versions for the docs are for every minor version released.

The docs are built using `mkdocs` (see [README](https://github.com/pivotal/docs-platform-automation/blob/develop/README.md) for build instructions). 
The docs make use of the [`mkdocs-pivotal-theme`](https://github.com/pivotal/mkdocs-pivotal-theme) for
the vmware-common formatting/css/etc for the docs site. 

### Link Linter
Inside of `mkdocs-pivotal-theme`, there is a helpful tool
that we use to make sure the links across all versions
are valid and working.
In the [ci](https://runway-ci.eng.vmware.com/teams/ppe-platform-automation/pipelines/platform-automation-docs), this linter is used in the `deploy-to-staging` job in the `docs` pipeline.

#### Broken Links
The link linter is very aggressive.
Sometimes the errors from the link linter are benign, and require a re-run:
```
https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/platform-automation/v5.0/concepts/stemcell-handling.html
	timeout	https://bosh.io/docs/stemcell/
```

Others require a little more manual work:
```
https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/platform-automation/v5.0/release-notes.html
	403	https://platform-automation-release-candidate.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-receipt-5.0.5
# REQUIRED FIX: download the 5.0.5 image,
# run dpkg -l > image-receipt-5.0.5,
# then upload to the platform-automation-release-candidate bucket in S3
```

Another example:
```
# From https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/docs/jobs/deploy-to-staging/builds/1964
https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/platform-automation/v4.0/index.html
	404	https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/pcf-interface.html
```
The steps to fix this link were:
1. search for the link in `docs-platform-automation/docs/.external_link_url.md`
1. use the same url for a version of Ops Manager known to have worked with the link
   (in this case, we navigated to: https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-10/customizing/pcf-interface.html)
1. switch the docs branch to the most recent version
1. remove the version information from the new url, and update it in the `.external_link_url` file
   (in this case, we used: https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/pcf-interface.html)
1. Commit changes, push, and allow the link linter to run again

#### "undefined code blocks"
The Link Linter will also check to make sure that there are no code blocks (` ``` ``` `)
in the documentation itself.
This is usually a sign that we are referencing a code snippet
that the docs don't know about,
or we updated the docs in that area in a way that made it so
mkdocs could not properly parse the code block.

In `docs-platform-automation/mkdocs.yml`, you will find the following:
```
- markdown-code-excerpt:
    sections:
      tasks: "../platform-automation"
      examples: "./docs/examples"
      reference: "./external/docs-platform-automation-reference-pipeline-config"
      paving: "./external/paving"
```
with this defined, we can reference any snippets in .yml from the listed repos.

The format for a snippet is (let's assume this is in `examples`):
```yaml
# code_snippet awesome-snippet-name start yaml
some-snippet
# code_snippet awesome-snippet-name end
```

This is used in the docs like so:
```
---excerpt--- "examples/awesome-snippet-name"
```

As long as the snippet is available, mkdocs will render it in the docs. 
If it is not available, it will be rendered as written above.

Because our docs take advantage of mkdocs tabbing (`=== "Tab Name"`),
the display often comes out incorrect with the code block used to format the snippet.
The link linter returns an error like the following if this happens:
```
Running a check for undefined code blocks (```)...
./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2281 <p>``` yaml
./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2287     ```</p>
./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2289 <p>``` yaml
./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2295     ```</p>

./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2305 <p>``` yaml
./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2311     ```</p>
./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2313 <p>``` yaml
./platform-automation/v4.4/how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.html:2319     ```</p>
Generated HTML contains undefined code blocks!
```

To fix this problem, if requires you to go into the `.md` of the effected file
and do a syntax check of the affected area.

#### "unidentified reference-style links"
The links in the docs are kept in `docs-platform-automation/docs/.internal_link_url.md` and `docs-platform-automation/docs/.external_link_url.md`
for easy updating and reference. 

When we use the links elsewhere in the docs, instead of using the `[link-name](link-url)` format,
we use [link-name][link-reference].

The link linter checks to make sure these custom references all go somewhere.
If they do no, you will get an error like the following:
```
Running a check for undefined reference-style links...

# SOLUTION: add the missing link to .external_link_url or .internal_link_url
```

## OM [Releases]( https://platform-automation.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/ci?group=om ) 

[Depending what kind of release you need to do](https://semver.org/), trigger a new build.
After the CI has completed go to [Github](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/releases) and update the release notes.

Most OM cli users will consume these upgrades through the Platform Automation toolkit, so every om cli bump should be accompanied by a Platform Automation release.

## Slack and Support

### Bugs in [Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2535033)
#### Github issues
When an issue is opened on the `om` or `docs-platform-automation`
a bug is auto-created in the Pivotal Tracker icebox.
Bugs generally have the format `git-org/project` with the name of the issue.

Ideally, issues should have a response from a dev 1+/wk
until an agreed-upon solution-proposal is found.
If there is no response from the issue opener,
give a reminder on the issue after 1 week.
After a second week, if there is still no response,
close the issue with a kind message and leave it up to the poster to reopen.
If the issue is reopened, a new bug will be generated in the Pivotal Tracker icebox.

#### CVEs
Ubuntu CVEs will also auto-populate in the Pivotal Tracker icebox.
These have the format:
```
**[Security Notice]** New USN
affecting Platform Automation Toolkit:
USN-####-#: pkg-name vulnerability
```
These should be handled using the steps detailed in the `CVEs and Patching Steps` section.
