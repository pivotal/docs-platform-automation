!!! warning
    The Platform Automation for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
    is currently in alpha and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only.

Platform Automation for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
is a set of tasks that wrap and extend [om][om],
a command-line interface to Ops Manager.

Platform Automation for PCF uses `om`,
(and by extension, the Ops Manager API)
to enable command-line interaction with Ops Manager,
a dashboard for installing, configuring, and updating software products on PCF.
Platform Automation for PCF comes bundled with Concourse tasks
that demonstrate how to use these tasks
in a containerized Continuous Integration (CI) system,
and a reference pipeline
showing one possible configuration of these tasks.

To learn more about Ops Manager,
see [Understanding the Ops Manager Interface][pivotalcf-understanding-opsman].

## What is Platform Automation for PCF
Platform Automation for PCF commands enable PCF operators
to script and automate Ops Manager actions.
Platform Automation for PCF commands are:

* **Legible**: They use configuration from
human-readable YAML files,
which users can edit,
and manage in version control.

* **Modular**: Each command has defined inputs and outputs
and performs a granular action.
They're designed to work together
to enable many different workflows.
Users can build systems to make changes to all their products together,
or one at a time.
Users can extract configuration from one environment
and use it as a template for configuring many more.

* **Built for Automation** Commands are idempotent,
so re-running them in a CI won't break builds.
They read and write config from files,
which machines can easily pass around.
They're available in a Docker container,
which makes the tools easy to use in CI.

* **Not Comprehensive**: Workflows that use Platform Automation for PCF
typically also contain `om` commands, custom tasks,
and even interactions with the Ops Manager user interface.
Platform Automation for PCF is a set of tools to use alongside other tools,
rather than a comprehensive solution.

Platform Automation for PCF comes bundled with Concourse [tasks][concourse-task-definition].
These task files wrap one or two Platform Automation for PCF commands
and their input and output definitions
in the YAML format that Concourse uses to build pipelines.
If you use a different CI/CD platform, you can use these Concourse files as examples
of the inputs, outputs, and arguments used in each step in the workflow.

The [Task Reference][task-reference] topic discusses these example tasks further.

## Before you begin
What do I need to understand up front?

If you’ve just downloaded Platform Automation for PCF,
it will be helpful to understand some things before you get started.
We recommend you read over this whole document before you dive into anything.

Platform Automation for PCF is a collection of tools and documentation.
It’s not a simple solution that can be “installed.”
It is intended to facilitate operator-owned automation
of both common and advanced workflows around Pivotal Ops Manager.
Ultimately, the resulting automation is a product of the operator.

Platform Automation for PCF is principally designed
to help operators create Concourse pipelines that suit their needs.
This means you’ll need Concourse deployed,
and that you’ll need to setup some Concourse resources.

While Platform Automation for PCF _can_ deploy an Ops Manager VM,
it doesn’t _have to_.
You can use it to automate an Ops Manager you already have.

There was a beta product from Pivotal called
“PCF Platform Automation with Concourse (PCF Pipelines)”.
It was never made publicly available and is deprecated.
If your current pipeline is based on PCF Pipelines,
we recommend building a replacement pipeline with the new tooling,
as opposed to trying to modify your existing pipeline to use the new tools.
Since Platform Automation for PCF can easily take over management of an existing Ops Manager,
this should be fairly straightforward.
Still, we may offer more detailed documentation for this workflow in the future,
and would like to hear from you if you feel that would be helpful.

Requirements

* Deployed Concourse
* Persisted datastore that can be accessed by Concourse resource (e.g. s3, gcs, minio)
* Pivnet access to [Platform Automation][pivnet-platform-automation]

!!! note
    Platform Automation for PCF is based on Concourse CI.
    We recommend that you have some familiarity with Conocurse before getting started.
    If you are new to Concourse, [Concourse CI Tutorials](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-concourse/3-0/guides.html) would be a good place to start.

* a valid [env file]: this file will contain credentials necessary to login to Ops Manager using the `om` CLI.
It is used by every task within Platform Automation for PCF
* a valid [auth file]: this file will contain the credentials necessary to create the Ops Manager login the first time
the VM is created. The choices for this file are simple or saml authentication.

!!! note
    There will be some crossover between the auth file and the env file due to how om is setup and how the system works. It is highly recommended to parameterize these values, and let a credential management system (such as Credhub) fill in these values for you in order to maintain consistency across files.

* a [opsmanager configuration] file: This file is required to connect to an IAAS, and control the lifecycle management
 of the Ops Manager VM
* a [director configuration] file: Each Ops Manager needs its own configuration, but it is retrieved differently from
a product configuration. This config is used to deploy a new Ops Manager director, or update an existing one.
* a set of valid [product configuration] files: Each product configuration is a yaml file that contains the properties
necessary to configure an Ops Manager product tile using the `om` tool. This can be used during install or update.
* (Optional) a working [credhub] setup with its own UAA client and secret.

Setup

1. Download the latest[Platform Automation][pivnet-platform-automation] from Pivnet.
   You will need:
 * `Concourse Tasks`
 * `Docker Image for Concourse Tasks`

!!! note
    If the pivnet link does not work for you,
    you might not have access to the product!
    Please communicate this in the #pcf-automation slack channel
    until the project is GA

1. Store the `platform-automation-image-*.tgz`
   in a blobstore that can be accessed via a Concourse pipeline.

1. Store the `platform-automation-tasks-*.zip`
   in a blobstore that can be accessed via a Concourse pipeline.

1. Next we'll create a test pipeline to see if the assets can be accessed correctly.
   This pipeline runs a test task, which ensures that all the parts work correctly.
   (the example pipeline assumes s3 as the blobstore)

```yaml
resources:
- name: platform-automation-tasks-s3
  type: s3
  source:
    access_key_id: ((access_key_id))
    secret_access_key: ((secret_access_key))
    region_name: ((region))
    bucket: ((bucket))
    regexp: platform-automation-tasks-(.*).zip

- name: platform-automation-image-s3
  type: s3
  source:
    access_key_id: ((access_key_id))
    secret_access_key: ((secret_access_key))
    region_name: ((region))
    bucket: ((bucket))
    regexp: platform-automation-image-(.*).tgz

jobs:
- name: test-resources
  plan:
  - aggregate:
    - get: platform-automation-tasks-s3
      params:
        unpack: true
    - get: platform-automation-image-s3
      params:
        unpack: true
  - task: test-resources
    image: platform-automation-image-s3
    file: platform-automation-tasks-s3/tasks/test.yml
```

Fill in the S3 resource credentials
and set the above pipeline on your Concourse instance.

!!! note
    The pipeline can use any blobstore.
    We choose S3 because the resource natively supported by Concourse.
    The S3 Concourse resource also supports S3-compatible blobstores (e.g. minio).
    See [S3 Resource](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource#source-configuration) for more information.
    If you want to use other blobstore, you need to provide a custom [resource type](https://concourse-ci.org/resource-types.html).

## Making Your Own Pipeline
If the example pipeline doesn’t work for you, that’s okay! It probably shouldn’t.
You know your environment and constraints, and we don’t.
We recommend you look at the tasks that make up the pipeline,
and see if they can be arranged such that they do what you need.
If you have Platform Architects available, they can help you look at this problem.

Our example just illustrates the tasks and provides one possible starting place
- the suggested starting projects provide other starting places that make different choices.
Your pipeline is yours, not a fork of something we wrote.

If the tasks themselves don’t work for you, we’d like to hear from you.
We might be able to help you figure out how to make it work,
or we can use the feedback to improve the tasks so they’re a better fit for what you need.
If you need to write your own tasks in the meantime, our tasks are designed with clear interfaces,
and should be able to coexist in a pipeline with tasks from other sources, or custom tasks you develop yourself.

## Ops Manager vs Platform Automation for PCF

Ops Manager manages PCF operations manually. Platform Automation for PCF lets you automate them.

### Ops Manager

Ops Manager lets you install and configure PCF and PCF products manually.
Its UI takes you through the configuration decisions or changes that you need to make in situations such as:

* Installing PCF for the first time.

* Changing product configurations as a result of human decisions.

* Running major or minor version upgrades of PCF or PCF products.

### Platform Automation for PCF

You can run Platform Automation for PCF manually from a command line.
But you can also embed them in scripts and pipelines
to perform Ops Manager functions when human attention is not needed, such as:

* Upgrading products to new patch versions.
  - Configuration settings should not differ between successive patch versions within the same minor version line.
    Underlying properties or property names may change,
    but the tile's upgrade process automatically translates properties to the new fields and values.
  - Pivotal cannot guarantee the functionality of upgrade scripts in third-party PCF product tiles.

* Replicating configuration settings from one product tile to the same product tile on a different foundation.
- Because properties and property names can change between patch versions of a product,
  you can only safely apply configuration settings across product tiles if their versions exactly match.
