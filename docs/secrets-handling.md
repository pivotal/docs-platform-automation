##  Using Your Credhub
Credhub can be used to store secure properties that you don't want committed into a config file.
Within your pipeline, the config file can then reference that Credhub value for runtime evaluation.

An example workflow would be storing an SSH key.

1. Authenticate with your credhub instance.
2. Generate an ssh key: `credhub generate --name="/private-foundation/opsman_ssh_key" --type=ssh`
3. Create an [opsmanager configuration] file that references the name of the property.

```yaml
opsman-configuration:
  azure:
    ssh_public_key: ((opsman_ssh_key.public_key))
```

4. Configure your pipeline to use the [credhub interpolate](reference/task.md#credhub-interpolate) task.
   It takes an input `files`, which should contain your configuration file from (3).

   The declaration within a pipeline might look like:

```yaml
jobs:
- name: example-job
  plan:
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
  - get: platform-automation-image
  - get: config
  - task: credhub-interpolate
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/credhub-interpolate.yml
    input_mapping:
      files: config
    params:
      # all required
      CREDHUB_CA_CERT: ((credhub_ca_cert))
      CREDHUB_CLIENT: ((credhub_client))
      CREDHUB_SECRET: ((credhub_secret))
      CREDHUB_SERVER: ((credhub_server))
      PREFIX: /private-foundation  
```

Notice the `PREFIX` has been set to `/private-foundation`, the path prefix defined for your cred in (2).
This allows the config file to have values scoped, for example, per foundation.
`params` should be filled in by the credhub created with your Concourse instance.

This task will reach out to the deployed credhub and fill in your entry references and return an output
named `interpolated-files` that can then be read as an input to any following tasks.

Our configuration will now look like

```yaml
opsman-configuration:
 azure:
   ssh_public_key: ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...
```
