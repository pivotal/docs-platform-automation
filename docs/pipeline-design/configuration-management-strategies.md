# Single Foundation

## Public Config Github Repo

The [Ops Manager + multiple products pipeline][reference-pipeline] 
is an example pipeline that can be used
as a reference for your foundation's pipeline.
The configs for this pipeline
are available on Github to clone and use as a basic starting point.
This config repo uses our "One Foundation per Repo" pattern.

The public example configs [can be found here][ref-pipeline-configs]
