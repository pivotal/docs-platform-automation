If you are using Platform Automation for the first time,
you have a few options.

Our [Overview][overview] of Platform Automation describes it conceptually,
and is useful to review prior to diving into more technical content.

## How-to Guides

We have in-depth procedures for deploying a new Ops Manager and
taking over management of an existing Ops Manager
with Platform Automation:

- For more information about deploying Platform Automation
  with a new Ops Manager, see [Installing Ops Manager][install-how-to].
- For more information about deploying Platform Automation
  with an existing Ops Manager, see
  [Upgrading an Existing Ops Manager][upgrade-how-to].

## Reference Pipelines

To see an example of a finished pipeline,
see one of the following reference pipelines:

- A [single-product pipeline][reference-pipeline-pks] using [PKS][pks]
- A [multi-product pipeline][reference-pipeline]
  with [PAS][pas] and [Healthwatch][healthwatch].
