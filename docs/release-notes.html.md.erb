### Bug Fixes
- The `om` CLI has been explicitly requesting `opaque` tokens.
  This was an unintentional and incidental change;
  previously it used `jwt`,
  the token format UAA provides by default.
  The `opaque` token may have been contributing to
  a hard-to-reproduce issue in a customer environment,
  so we're explicitly switching back to `jwt` tokens.
- CVE update to container image.
  Resolves [USN 5021-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5021-1),
  an issue related to libcurl.

### Features
- [`configure-opsman`](./tasks.html#configure-opsman) task can now configure the UAA token expirations and timeouts.

   ```yaml
   tokens-expiration:
     access_token_expiration: 10
     refresh_token_expiration: 10
     session_idle_timeout: 10
   ```

### Bug Fixes
- [`update-runtime-config`](./tasks.html#update-runtime-config) task has the `releases` input as optional.
  When looking for `releases`, if the input wasn't there then the task would fail.
  A check has been added to ensure the input is there.
- With long-running tasks (using `om` commands),
  sometimes the authentication token would expire.
  If possible the token will be refreshed.
  This should help with HTTP retries.  
- CVE update to container image. Resolves [USN-4608-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4608-1).
  The CVEs are related to vulnerabilities with `ca-certificates` and related libraries.
- CVE update to container image. Resolves [USN-4635-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4635-1).

## v4.4.11
October 9, 2020

**CLI Versions**

| Name | version |
|---|---|
| om | [6.4.1](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/releases/tag/6.4.1) |
| bosh-cli | [v6.4.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli/releases/tag/v6.4.0) |

The full Docker image-receipt: <a href="https://platform-automation-release-candidate.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-receipt-4.4.11" target="_blank">Download</a>

### Bug Fixes
- The "bug fixes" for collections in `om` 6.1.2+
  were causing unexpected issues in some tiles.
  The collection work has been reverted
  to its original functionality.
- [`pending-changes`](./tasks.html#check-pending-changes) and [`stage-configure-apply`](./tasks.html#stage-configure-apply)
  would always fail if a product is unconfigured, new, or missing a stemcell,
  regardless of whether `ALLOW_PENDING_CHANGES` was set.
  This has been fixed. `pending-changes` will only fail if `ALLOW_PENDING_CHANGES: false`.
- [`stage-product`](./tasks.html#stage-product) and [`stage-configure-apply`](./tasks.html#stage-configure-apply)
  will now accept `latest` as the `product-version`
  if you are providing a `CONFIG_FILE`/`STAGE_PRODUCT_CONFIG_FILE`.
  This fixes an issue that required users to update their config file
  every time a new version was available on Ops Manager.
- [`stage-configure-apply`](./tasks.html#stage-configure-apply) will now treat the `product` input
  as truly optional if `CONFIG_FILE` is provided.

The full Docker image-receipt: <a href="https://platform-automation-release-candidate.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-receipt-4.4.9" target="_blank">Download</a>

### Bug Fixes
- There was an issue with how `om` retrieved credentials
  within the new heuristic logic for collections updates.
  In particular, this impacted the upgrade from TAS 2.6 to 2.7,
  and caused `configure-product` to fail.
  The error message looked something like this:
  
    ```bash
    2020/09/01 06:35:54 could not execute "configure-product": failed to configure product: failed to associate guids for property ".properties.credhub_internal_provider_keys" because:
    request failed: unexpected response from /api/v0/deployed/products/cf-6bdb4038d37667f9f424/credentials/.properties.credhub_internal_provider_keys[0].key:

## v4.4.7
Released September 4, 2020

**CLI Versions**

| Name | version |
|---|---|
| om | [6.1.0](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/releases/tag/6.1.0) |

The full Docker image-receipt: <a href="https://platform-automation-release-candidate.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-receipt-4.4.7" target="_blank">Download</a>

### Bug Fixes
- tl;dr: If you have experienced the following error with the [`create-vm`](./tasks.html#create-vm) task, this problem is now fixed.
  
    ```bash
    creating the new opsman vm
    Using gcp...
    Error: unexpected error: could not marshal image file: yaml: unmarshal errors:
      line 6: cannot unmarshal !!map into string
    ```
  
    With GCP OpsManager, the image YAML file format includes a new key.
    
    The original format of the image YAML was:
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    us: ops-manager-us/pcf-gcp-2.9.9-build.164.tar.gz
    eu: ops-manager-us/pcf-gcp-2.9.9-build.164.tar.gz
    asia: ops-manager-us/pcf-gcp-2.9.9-build.164.tar.gz
    ```
    
    The new format includes the `image` key:
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    us: ops-manager-us/pcf-gcp-2.9.10-build.177.tar.gz
    eu: ops-manager-us/pcf-gcp-2.9.10-build.177.tar.gz
    asia: ops-manager-us/pcf-gcp-2.9.10-build.177.tar.gz
    image:
     name: ops-manager-2-9-10-build-177
     project: pivotal-ops-manager-images
    ```
    
    This patch ignores this value, where previously it would've not been able to parse it.
    
- The container image has been fixed to support the `registry-image` Concourse resource
- With [`credhub-interpolate`](./tasks.html#credhub-interpolate) task,
  users were using secrets as a way to interpolate the same CredHub value to multiple vars values.
  This allowed not having ot repeat the same value in CredHub for each var value.
  Support has been added to the [`prepare-tasks-with-secrets`](./tasks.html#prepare-tasks-with-secrets) workflow to support secrets evaluation.
  
    For example, given a `config.yml`,
  
    ```yaml
    product-name: some
    product-properties:
      email-password: ((email-password))
      ssh-password: ((ssh-password))
    ```
  
    And given a `vars.yml`,
    
    ```yaml
    email-password: ((password))
    ssh-password: ((password))
    ```
    
    Each task will now fully evaluate the parameter `((password))` as a value from the Concourse configured secret manager.
    This fixes the issue where `((password))` would have been the actual _string_ value for
    `email-password` and `ssh-password`.

## v4.4.6
Released August 20, 2020

**CLI Versions**

| Name | version |
|---|---|
| om | [6.1.0](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/releases/tag/6.1.0) |

The full Docker image-receipt: <a href="https://platform-automation-release-candidate.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image-receipt-4.4.6" target="_blank">Download</a>

### Bug Fixes
- `configure-product` will no longer assign a new GUID for unnamed collections.
  This means that for some tiles,
  configure-product will now avoid unnecessary changes to collections.
- `download-product` will work with supported versions of TAS Windows
  released after Friday August 20th, 2020.
  These versions do not work with older versions of Platform Automation.
  The TAS Windows tiles on the Broadcom Support portal now include Open Source License files
  in the tile itself.
  Platform Automation needed to bump the winfs-injector version
  to ensure compatibility with this new arrangement.
- CVE updates to container image. Resolves [USN-4466-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4466-1)
  The CVE is related to vulnerabilities in curl and libcurl.

### Bug Fixes
- When using [`update-runtime-config`](./tasks.html#update-runtime-config task,
  we've added the `param` for `RELEASES_GLOB` to help limit the releases being uploaded.
  This is especially useful when using the bosh-io-release concourse resource,
  which has other files besides the `release.tgz` when it peforms a `get`.
- CVE update to container image. Resolves [USN-4402-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4402-1/).
  The CVEs are related to vulnerabilities with `curl` and related libraries.

### What's New
- The [`stage-product`](./tasks.html#stage-product) and [`stage-configure-apply`](./tasks.html#stage-configure-apply) tasks
  have been updated to no longer require a `product` input.

    This change allows tiles to be staged without requiring the product file to be passed to these tasks.
    If the `product` input is not provided,
    the `CONFIG_FILE` and `STAGE_PRODUCT_CONFIG_FILE` params **are required** in their appropriate tasks.

- [`upgrade-opsman`](./tasks.html#upgrade-opsman) now supports configuring settings
  on the Ops Manager Settings page in the UI.
  This utilizes the `configure-opsman` command from `om`,
  and runs after the upgrade command.
  Configuration can be added directly to [`opsman.yml`](./inputs-outputs.html#ops-manager-config).
  An example of all configurable properties can be found in the "Additional Settings" tab.

- [`configure-opsman`](./tasks.html#configure-opsman) task has been added.

    This task supports configuring settings
    on the Ops Manager Settings page in the UI.

    Configuration can be added directly to [`opsman.yml`](./inputs-outputs.html#ops-manager-config).
    An example of all configurable properties can be found in the "Additional Settings" tab.

- [`download-product`](./tasks.html#download-product) now supports
  specifying a version in the config file for the stemcell
  if the latest stemcell for the product is not desired.

    An example config for downloading a product from the Broadcom Support portal:

    ```yaml
    # download-product.yml
    ---
    pivnet-api-token: token
    pivnet-file-glob: "*.pivotal"
    pivnet-product-slug: product-slug
    product-version: 1.2.3
    stemcell-iaas: aws
    stemcell-version: 90.90

-  The [`prepare-image`](./tasks.html#prepare-image) task has been added.

     This task allows you to temporarily inject a CA onto the Platform Automation image
     for use in subsequent tasks within the same job.

     This updated image _does not need to be persisted_,
     and can be used directly by subsequent tasks with no other changes to `pipeline.yml`.

     The task allows proper ssl validation when using `om` commands.
     To fully take advantage of this feature, remove `skip-ssl-validation: true` from your `env.yml`.

     For an example of how this fits into a `pipeline.yml`, check out the [Operations Manager + Multiple Products pipeline](./pipelines/multiple-products.html).

-  The [`replicate-product`](./tasks.html##replicate-product) task has been added.
   This task requires a downloaded product,
   and will output the replicated product for isolation segments.

     Supported products: `p-isolation-segment`, `p-windows-runtime`, `pas-windows`

- The [`update-runtime-config`](./tasks.html#update-runtime-config) task has been added.
  *Please note this is an advanced feature, and should be used with caution.*
