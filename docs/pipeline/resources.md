!!! info 
    These Concourse pipelines are examples
    on how to use the [tasks](../reference/task.md). 
    If you use a different CI/CD platform, you can use these Concourse files as examples
    of the inputs, outputs, and arguments used in each step in the workflow.
    

## Making Your Own Pipeline

If the reference pipeline doesn’t work for you, that’s okay! It probably shouldn’t.
You know your environment and constraints, and we don’t.
We recommend you look at the tasks that make up the pipeline,
and see if they can be arranged such that they do what you need.
If you have Platform Architects available, they can help you look at this problem.

Our example just illustrates the tasks and provides one possible starting place
- the suggested starting projects provide other starting places that make different choices.
Your pipeline is yours, not a fork of something we wrote.

If the tasks themselves don’t work for you, we’d like to hear from you.
We might be able to help you figure out how to make it work,
or we can use the feedback to improve the tasks so they’re a better fit for what you need.
If you need to write your own tasks in the meantime, our tasks are designed with clear interfaces,
and should be able to coexist in a pipeline with tasks from other sources, or custom tasks you develop yourself.

## Prerequisites

* Deployed Concourse

!!! info
    Platform Automation for PCF is based on Concourse CI.
    We recommend that you have some familiarity with Concourse before getting started.
    If you are new to Concourse, [Concourse CI Tutorials](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-concourse/3-0/guides.html) would be a good place to start.

* Persisted datastore that can be accessed by Concourse resource (e.g. s3, gcs, minio)
* Pivnet access to [Platform Automation][pivnet-platform-automation]
* A set of valid [download-product-config] files: Each product has a configuration YAML of what version to download from Pivotal Network. 

## Retrieval from Pivotal Network

{% include "./.opsman_filename_change_note.md" %}

The pipeline downloads dependencies consumed by the tasks
and places them into a trusted s3-like storage provider.
This helps other concourse deployments without internet access
retrieve task dependencies.

!!! tip "S3 filename prefixing"
    Note the unique regex format for blob names,
    for example: `\[p-healthwatch,(.*)\]p-healthwatch-.*.pivotal`.
    Pivnet filenames will not always contain the necessary metadata
    to accurately download files from S3.
    So, the product slug and version are prepended when using `download-product`.
    For more information on how this works,
    and what to expect when using `download-product` and `download-product-s3`,
    refer to the [`download-product` task reference.][download-product]

The pipeline requires configuration for the [download-product](../reference/task.md#download-product) task.
Below are examples that can be used.

``` yaml tab="Healthwatch"
{% include './examples/download-product-configs/healthwatch.yml' %}
```

``` yaml tab="PAS"
{% include './examples/download-product-configs/pas.yml' %}
```

``` yaml tab="PAS Windows"
{% include './examples/download-product-configs/pas-windows.yml' %}
```

``` yaml tab="OpsMan"
{% include './examples/download-product-configs/opsman.yml' %}
```

``` yaml tab="PKS"
{% include './examples/download-product-configs/pks.yml' %}
```

## Pipeline Components

### Resource Types

This custom resource type uses the pivnet resource to pull down and separate both 
pieces of the Platform Automation product (tasks and image) so they can be stored 
separately in S3. 

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-resource-types' %}

### Product Resources

S3 resources where Platform Automation [`download-product`][download-product] outputs
will be stored. Each product/stemcell needs a separate resource defined. 

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-resources-product' %}

### Platform Automation Resources

`platform-automation-pivnet` is downloaded directly from Pivnet and will be used to 
download all other products from Pivnet. 

`platform-automation-tasks` and `platform-automation-image` are S3 resources that will
be stored for internet-restricted, or faster, access.

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-resources-platform-automation' %}

### Exported Installation Resource

{% include "./.export_installation_note.md" %}

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-export-installation' %}

### Configured Resources

You will need to add these to your configurations repo. These contain values for your
env file, which must be manually created. 
For more details, see the [Inputs and Outputs][inputs-outputs] section.

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-resources-configurations' %}

### Trigger Resources
 
{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-resources-triggers' %}

### Credhub Interpolate Job

`((foundation))` is a value intended to be replaced by the filepath of your foundation
directory structure in github (if you are not using multi-foundation, this value can be removed).

`((credhub-*))` are values for accessing your Concourse Credhub. These are set when `fly`-ing your 
pipeline. For more information on how to fly your pipeline and use `((foundation))`, please
reference our How To Guides for your specific workflow.

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-interpolate-creds' %}

### Jobs

Each job corresponds to a "box" on the visual representation of your Concourse pipeline.
These jobs consume resources defined above.

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'resources-pipeline-jobs' %}

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'put-resources-pipeline' %}  //TODO: edit snippet names, then delete this line

{% with path="../" %}
    {% include ".internal_link_url.md" %}
{% endwith %}
{% include ".external_link_url.md" %}
