# Generating an Env file

Almost all [`om` commands](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om) require an env file
to describe how to communicate (and authenticate) with a given VMware Tanzu Operations Manager.

There are two ways to provide auth information.

## Username and password

If your configuration choices allow you to use `username` and `password` directly,
you can do so:

<%= partial "../examples/env" %>

## UAA client

However, if you're using an external identity provider
via SAML or LDAP integration,
you'll need to use a UAA client via `client-id` and `client-secret`:

<%= partial "../examples/env-uaa" %>

While `decryption-passphrase` is nominally optional,
if you intend to use a single `env.yml` for an entire pipeline,
it will be necessary to include for use with the `import-installation` step.
