    Notice the additional element to the cred paths;
    the foundation name.
    <br>
    If you look at <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/credhub-credential-manager.html">Concourse lookup rules</a>,
    you'll see that it searches the pipeline-specific path
    before the team path.
    Since our pipeline is named for the foundation it's used to manage,
    we can use this to scope access to our foundation-specific information
    to just this pipeline.
    <br>
    By contrast, the Broadcom Support portal token may be valuable across several pipelines
    (and associated foundations), so we scoped that to our team.</p>
