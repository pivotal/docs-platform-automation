<b>CredHub paths and pipeline names</b>:
<br>
Notice that we've added an element to the cred paths;
now we're using the foundation name.

If you look at [Concourse's lookup rules](https://concourse-ci.org/credhub-credential-manager.html#credential-lookup-rules),
you'll see that it searches the pipeline-specific path
before the team path.
Since our pipeline is named for the foundation it's used to manage,
we can use this to scope access to our foundation-specific information
to just this pipeline.

By contrast, the Broadcom Support token may be valuable across several pipelines
(and associated foundations),
so we scoped that to our team.</p>
