!!! info "Credhub paths and pipeline names"
    
    Notice that we've added an element to the cred paths;
    now we're using the foundation name.
    
    If you look at [Concourse's lookup rules,][concourse-credhub-lookup-rules]
    you'll see that it searches the pipeline-specific path
    before the team path.
    Since our pipeline is named for the foundation it's used to manage,
    we can use this to scope access to our foundation-specific information
    to just this pipeline.
    
    By contrast, the Pivnet token may be valuable across several pipelines
    (and associated foundations),
    so we scoped that to our team.
