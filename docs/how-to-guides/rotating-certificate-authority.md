# Writing a pipeline to rotate the foundation Certificate Authority

This how-to-guide shows you how to write a pipeline for rotating the
certificate authority on an existing VMware Tanzu Operations Manager.

## Prerequisites
1. A pipeline, such as one created in [Installing Tanzu Operations Manager][install-how-to] 
   or [Upgrading an existing Tanzu Operations Manager][upgrade-how-to].
1. A fully configured Tanzu Operations Manager and Director.
1. The Platform Automation Toolkit Docker Image [imported and ready to run][running-commands-locally].

## Creating the Pipeline
We will be creating a new pipeline for this workflow. It will ultimately
rotate the certificate authority for a single foundation via a series of jobs,
but it will start with some resources. Create a file titled `ca-rotation.yml`
with this content:
```yaml
---
resource_types:
- name: pivnet
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: pivotalcf/pivnet-resource
    tag: latest-final
resources:
- name: platform-automation
  type: pivnet
  source:
    product_slug: platform-automation
    api_token: ((pivnet-refresh-token))
- name: config
  type: git
  source:
    uri: ((pipeline-repo))
    private_key: ((plat-auto-pipes-deploy-key.private_key))
    branch: main
```

This will give us access to the Platform Automation tasks and the environment
configuration file.

We will also set this new pipeline.
```bash
fly -t control-plane set-pipeline -p foundation -c ca-rotation.yml
```

## Generating a Root Certificate Authority
There are two methods to configure a new root certificate authority in Ops
Manager:

1. Use Tanzu Operations Manager to generate a new certificate authority.
1. Give Tanzu Operations Manager an existing root certificate authority to use.

!!! warning "Use with `pivotal-container-service` tile"
    Rotating certificate authority with the pivotal-container-service
    tile installed will cause warnings in the pipeline. Only certificates
    managed by Tanzu Operations Manager will be rotated in this process!

Regardless of method, we are going to add our first job to the pipeline.
```yaml
jobs:
- name: configure-new-ca
  plan:
  - get: env
    resource: config
  - get: platform-automation-image
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
      unpack: true
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
      unpack: true
  - task: configure-new-ca
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/configure-new-certificate-authority.yml
```

### Generate a New Certificate Authority
If we want a certificate authority generated by Tanzu Operations Manager, the above job
will create it for us.

### Configure Tanzu Operations Manager to Use an Existing Certificate Authority
If we want to provide a certificate authority to the Tanzu Operations Manager to use (e.g.
an externally signed certificate), we can provide that to the Tanzu Operations Manager
with an input resource and additional configuration of the task.

We'll add an [S3 resource][s3-resource] and the configuration repo
to the `resources` section:
```yaml hl_lines="2-8"
resources:
- name: certificate-authority
  type: s3
  source:
    access_key_id: ((s3-access-key-id))
    secret_access_key: ((s3-secret-key))
    bucket: ((certificate-authority-bucket))
    regexp: (certificate|privatekey)\.pem
```
Also, we will fetch the resource before the task. This will configure the task
to use the `certificate.pem` and `privatekey.pem` files from the s3 resource
as the new CA in Tanzu Operations Manager.
```yaml hl_lines="1-2"
  - get: certs
    resource: certificate-authority
  - get: env
    resource: config
  - task: configure-new-ca
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/configure-new-certificate-authority.yml
```

### Apply Changes
After configuring a new certificate authority, Tanzu Operations Manager needs to apply
changes before the new CA is available to generate and sign certificates. This
also registers the CA with components so that they will trust certificates
from the new CA. This next job will be appended after the `configure-new-ca`
job.
```yaml
- name: apply-changes
  plan:
  - get: env
    resource: config
    passed:
    - configure-new-ca
  - task: apply-new-ca
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/apply-changes.yml
```

## Activate the New Certificate Authority
We need to set our new certificate authority as the active certificate authority. After this, any certificates created by the Credhub will be signed by the new CA.
Append a new job to the end of the jobs list.
```yaml
- name: activate-new-ca
  plan:
  - get: env
    resource: config
    passed:
    - apply-changes
  - get: platform-automation-image
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
      unpack: true
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
      unpack: true
  - task: activate-new-ca
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/activate-certificate-authority.yml
```

## Regenerate Certificates

### Non-configurable Leaf Certificates
Now that a new certificate authority is active, any internal, non-configurable certificates need to be regenerated and signed by the new CA. We are going to add another job that will regenerate the non configurable leaf certificates.
```yaml
- name: regenerate-non-configurable-leaf-certificates
  plan:
  - get: env
    resource: config
    passed:
    - activate-new-ca
  - get: platform-automation-image
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
      unpack: true
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
      unpack: true
  - task: regenerate-certificates
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/regenerate-certificates.yml
```
This will delete the existing certificates from Credhub, which causes Credhub to generate new certificates on the next run of Apply Changes.

### Configurable Certificates
Any manually configured certificates that are signed by the foundation root certificate authority need to be regenerated as well. Tanzu Application Service needs at least two configurable certificates, one for networking components and one for UAA.
After generating a new certificate, it needs to be configured in Tanzu Operations Manager with a manifest file specific to the certificate.

Please check the docs on how to [rotate CAs and leaf certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/security/pcf-infrastructure/rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html#rotate-config-after-new-root) to manually rotate.

### Apply Changes
Now we need to apply changes in order to create and use the new certificates.
```yaml
- name: apply-certificate-changes
  plan:
  - get: env
    resource: config
    passed:
    - regenerate-non-configurable-leaf-certificates
  - task: apply-new-ca
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/apply-changes.yml
```

## Cleaning Up
Once the function of the foundation is validated with new certificates, the old certificate authority can be deleted by adding a job that will cleanup the certificate authority and applying the changes.
```yaml
- name: cleanup-certificate-authorities
  plan:
  - get: env
    resource: config
    passed:
    - apply-certificate-changes
  - get: platform-automation-image
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
      unpack: true
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
      unpack: true
  - task: delete-certificate-authority
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/delete-certificate-authority.yml
  - task: apply-new-ca
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/apply-changes.yml
```
