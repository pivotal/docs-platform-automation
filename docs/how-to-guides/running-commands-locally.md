This topic describes how to execute commands locally with Docker.

If you wish to use the underlying `om` and `p-automator` CLI tools from your local workstation,
we recommend using docker to execute commands.

With `p-automator` in particular, using Docker is necessary,
as the IaaS CLIs upon which we depend can be tricky to install.
With `om` it's more a matter of convenience -
you can just as easily [download the binary][om-releases] if it's available for your system.


## Executing Commands

To execute commands in Docker:

1. First import the image:

    ```bash
      docker import ${PLATFORM_AUTOMATION_IMAGE_TGZ} platform-automation-image
    ```

    Where `${PLATFORM_AUTOMATION_IMAGE_TGZ}` is the image file downloaded from Tanzu Network.

2. Then, you can use `docker run` to pass it arbitrary commands.

    Here, we're running the `p-automator` CLI to see what commands are available:

    ```bash
      docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace platform-automation-image \
        p-automator -h
    ```

    Note:  that this will have access read and write files in your current working directory.
    If you need to mount other directories as well, you can add additional `-v` arguments.

## Useful Commands

### Retrieving Product Staged Configuration

```bash
  docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace platform-automation-image \
    export OM_PASSWORD='ASDF' om --env ${ENV_FILE} staged-config \
    --product-name ${PRODUCT_SLUG} --include-placeholders
```

  `${ENV_FILE}` is the [environment file][env] required for all tasks.
  `${PRODUCT_SLUG}` is the name of the product downloaded from [Tanzu Network][tanzu-network].
  The resulting file can then be parameterized, saved, and committed to a config repo.

### Retrieving Director Configuration

```bash
  docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/workspace -w /workspace platform-automation-image \
    om --env ${ENV_FILE} staged-director-config --include-placeholders
```

### Ops Manager Targeting

Use environment variables to set what Ops Manager `om` is targeting.
For example: 

```bash
 docker run -it -e "OM_PASSWORD=my-password" --rm -v $PWD:/workspace \
    -w /workspace platform-automation-image \
    om --env ${ENV_FILE} staged-director-config --include-placeholders
```

Note the additional space before the `docker` command.
This ensures the command is not kept in bash history. 
The environment variable OM_PASSWORD will overwrite the password value in the `ENV_FILE`.
See the [`om` GitHub page][om] for a full list of supported environment variables. 

### Disable Verifiers

In cases where verifiers are failing incorrectly,
it will be necessary to disable those verifiers in order to apply changes.
Depending on the failing verifier, `om` has commands to disable them:
`disable-director-verifiers` and `disable-product-verifiers`.

For director verifiers:
```bash
  docker run -it -e "OM_PASSWORD=my-password" --rm -v $PWD:/workspace \
    -w /workspace platform-automation-image \
    om --env ${ENV_FILE} disable-director-verifiers \
    --type ${VERIFIER_TYPE}
```

Where `${VERIFIER_TYPE}` is the failing verifier.

For product verifiers:
```bash
  docker run -it -e "OM_PASSWORD=my-password" --rm -v $PWD:/workspace \
    -w /workspace platform-automation-image \
    om --env ${ENV_FILE} disable-product-verifiers \
    --product-name ${PRODUCT_NAME} --type ${VERIFIER_TYPE}
```

Where `${VERIFIER_TYPE}` is the failing verifier
and `${PRODUCT_NAME}` is the metadata name of the associated product.

A list of failed verifiers is available in the output from the Apply Changes attempt.
To retrieve a list of currently failing director and product verifiers
without applying changes (from Ops Manager 2.6 forward) run:

```bash
  docker run -it -e "OM_PASSWORD=my-password" --rm -v $PWD:/workspace \
    -w /workspace platform-automation-image \
    om --env ${ENV_FILE} pre-deploy-check
```

The Ops Manager Documentation [has additional details][opsman-verifiers-docs] about managing verifiers.
