# Writing a pipeline to rotate the foundation Certificate Authority

This topic shows you how to write a pipeline for rotating the
certificate authority on an existing VMware Tanzu Operations Manager.

## Prerequisites

* A pipeline, such as one created in [Installing Tanzu Operations Manager](./installing-opsman.md)
   or [Upgrading an existing Tanzu Operations Manager](./upgrade-existing-opsman.md)
* A fully configured Tanzu Operations Manager and Director
* The Platform Automation Toolkit Docker Image [imported and ready to run](./running-commands-locally.md)

## Creating the pipeline

You will be creating a new pipeline for this workflow. It will ultimately
rotate the certificate authority for a single foundation via a series of jobs,
but it will start with some resources.

1. Create a file titled `ca-rotation.yml` with this content:

    ```yaml
    ---
    resource_types:
    - name: pivnet
      type: docker-image
      source:
        repository: pivotalcf/pivnet-resource
        tag: latest-final
    resources:
    - name: platform-automation
      type: pivnet
      source:
        product_slug: platform-automation
        api_token: ((pivnet-refresh-token))
    - name: config
      type: git
      source:
        uri: ((pipeline-repo))
        private_key: ((plat-auto-pipes-deploy-key.private_key))
        branch: main
    ```

    This will give us access to the Platform Automation tasks and the environment
    configuration file.

1. Set this new pipeline.

    ```bash
    fly -t control-plane set-pipeline -p foundation -c ca-rotation.yml
    ```

## Generating a Root Certificate Authority

There are two methods to configure a new root certificate authority in Ops
Manager:

* Use Tanzu Operations Manager to generate a new certificate authority.
* Give Tanzu Operations Manager an existing root certificate authority to use.

<p class="note caution">
<span class="note__title">Caution</span>
<b>Use with <code>pivotal-container-service</code> tile:</b>
Rotating certificate authority with the pivotal-container-service
tile installed causes warnings in the pipeline. Only certificates
managed by Tanzu Operations Manager will be rotated in this process.</p>

1. For both methods, the first step is to add the job to the pipeline.

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - name: configure-new-ca
      plan:
      - get: env
        resource: config
      - get: platform-automation-image
        resource: platform-automation
        params:
          globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
          unpack: true
      - get: platform-automation-tasks
        resource: platform-automation
        params:
          globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
          unpack: true
      - task: configure-new-ca
        image: platform-automation-image
        file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/configure-new-certificate-authority.yml
    ```

1. **Option 1:** Generate a new Certificate Authority. If you want a certificate authority
generated by Tanzu Operations Manager, the job shown in the previous step will create it for you.

1. **Option 2:** Configure Tanzu Operations Manager to use an existing Certificate Authority. To
provide a certificate authority to the Tanzu Operations Manager to use (for example,
an externally signed certificate), we can provide that to the Tanzu Operations Manager
with an input resource and additional configuration of the task.

    1. Add an [S3 resource](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) and the configuration repo
    to the `resources` section:

        ```yaml hl_lines="2-8"
        resources:
        - name: certificate-authority
          type: s3
          source:
            access_key_id: ((s3-access-key-id))
            secret_access_key: ((s3-secret-key))
            bucket: ((certificate-authority-bucket))
            regexp: (certificate|privatekey)\.pem
        ```

    1. Fetch the resource before the task. This will configure the task
    to use the `certificate.pem` and `privatekey.pem` files from the s3 resource
    as the new CA in Tanzu Operations Manager.

        ```yaml hl_lines="1-2"
          - get: certs
            resource: certificate-authority
          - get: env
            resource: config
          - task: configure-new-ca
            image: platform-automation-image
            file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/configure-new-certificate-authority.yml
        ```

1. Apply the changes. After configuring a new certificate authority, Tanzu Operations Manager must apply
changes before the new CA is available to generate and sign certificates. This
also registers the CA with components so that they will trust certificates
from the new CA. This next job will be appended after the `configure-new-ca`
job.

    ```yaml
    - name: apply-changes
      plan:
      - get: env
        resource: config
        passed:
        - configure-new-ca
      - task: apply-new-ca
        image: platform-automation-image
        file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/apply-changes.yml
    ```

1. Activate the new Certificate Authority. Set your new certificate authority as the active certificate authority. After this, any certificates created by the CredHub will be signed by the new CA.
Append a new job to the end of the jobs list.

    ```yaml
    - name: activate-new-ca
      plan:
      - get: env
        resource: config
        passed:
        - apply-changes
      - get: platform-automation-image
        resource: platform-automation
        params:
          globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
          unpack: true
      - get: platform-automation-tasks
        resource: platform-automation
        params:
          globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
          unpack: true
      - task: activate-new-ca
        image: platform-automation-image
        file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/activate-certificate-authority.yml
    ```

1. Regenerate the certificates:

    1. Non-configurable leaf certificates: Now that a new certificate authority is active, any internal, non-configurable certificates need to be regenerated and signed by the new CA. We are going to add another job that will regenerate the non configurable leaf certificates.

        ```yaml
        - name: regenerate-non-configurable-leaf-certificates
          plan:
          - get: env
            resource: config
            passed:
            - activate-new-ca
          - get: platform-automation-image
            resource: platform-automation
            params:
              globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
              unpack: true
          - get: platform-automation-tasks
            resource: platform-automation
            params:
              globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
              unpack: true
          - task: regenerate-certificates
            image: platform-automation-image
            file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/regenerate-certificates.yml
        ```

        This will delete the existing certificates from CredHub, which causes CredHub to generate new certificates on the next run of Apply Changes.

      1. Configurable certificates: Any manually configured certificates that are signed by the foundation root certificate authority need to be regenerated as well. Tanzu Application Service needs at least two configurable certificates, one for networking components and one for UAA.
      After generating a new certificate, it needs to be configured in Tanzu Operations Manager with a manifest file specific to the certificate.<br>
      See [rotate CAs and leaf certificates](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/tanzu-operations-manager/3-0/tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html) to manually rotate the CAs and certificates.

      <!-- https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/security-pcf-infrastructure-rotate-cas-and-leaf-certs.html -->

1. Apply changes to create and use the new certificates.

    ```yaml
    - name: apply-certificate-changes
      plan:
      - get: env
        resource: config
        passed:
        - regenerate-non-configurable-leaf-certificates
      - task: apply-new-ca
        image: platform-automation-image
        file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/apply-changes.yml
    ```

## Cleaning up

After the function of the foundation is validated with new certificates, the old certificate authority can be deleted by adding a job that will cleanup the certificate authority and apply the changes.

```yaml
- name: cleanup-certificate-authorities
  plan:
  - get: env
    resource: config
    passed:
    - apply-certificate-changes
  - get: platform-automation-image
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*image*.tgz"]
      unpack: true
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
    resource: platform-automation
    params:
      globs: ["*tasks*.zip"]
      unpack: true
  - task: delete-certificate-authority
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/delete-certificate-authority.yml
  - task: apply-new-ca
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/apply-changes.yml
```
