## Generating an Env File
Almost all [`om`][om] commands require an env file
to describe how to communicate (and authenticate) with a given Ops Manager.

There are two ways to provide auth information.
If your configuration choices allow you to use `username` and `password` directly,
you can do so:

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'env' %}

However, if you're using an external identity provider
via SAML or LDAP integration,
you'll need to use a UAA client via `client-id` and `client-secret`:

{% code_snippet 'examples', 'env-uaa' %}

While `decryption-passphrase` is nominally optional,
if you intend to use a single `env.yml` for an entire pipeline,
it will be necessary to include for use with the `import-installation` step.

{% with path="../" %}
    {% include ".internal_link_url.md" %}
{% endwith %}
{% include ".external_link_url.md" %}
