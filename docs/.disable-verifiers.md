    Ops Manager Verifier failures when applying changes will prevent deployment.
    In cases where these verifiers are incorrectly failing for known reasons,
    they should be disabled [using om][disable-verifiers].
    The ` --ignore-warnings` option for `om apply-changes`
    allows users to ignore all warnings from ignorable verifiers.
    This option is not available in Platform Automation.
    In an automation context, disabling _only the particular verifiers_
    where failure is well-understood allows other verifiers
    to continue to provide important feedback.
