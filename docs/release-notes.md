!!! warning "Azure Updating to 2.5"
     Ops Manager will be removing the necessity to provide availability zones for azure.
     If your `director.yml`(see [`staged-director-config`](./reference/task.md#staged-director-config))
     has a block like the following in the networks section:
     ```yaml
        availability_zone_names:
        - "null"
     ```
     your deployment will have the following error:
     ```json
     {"errors":["Availability zones cannot find availability zone with name null"]}
     ```
     To fix this error, please remove the `availability_zone_names` section from your azure config, or re-run
     [`staged-director-config`](./reference/task.md#staged-director-config) to update your `director.yml`.

## v3.0.4
**Release Date** Thursday, July 11, 2019

### Bug Fixes
- Both [`configure-ldap-authentication`][configure-ldap-authentication] 
  and [`configure-saml-authentication`][configure-saml-authentication]
  will now automatically
  create a BOSH UAA admin client as documented [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/opsmanager-create-bosh-client.html#saml).
  This is only supported in OpsManager 2.4 and greater.
  You may specify the option `skip-create-bosh-admin-client` in your config YAML
  to skip creating this client.
  After the client has been created,
  you can find the client ID and secret
  by following [steps three and four found here](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/opsmanager-create-bosh-client.html#-provision-admin-client).
  
    _This feature needs to be enabled
    to properly automate authentication for the bosh director when using LDAP and SAML._
    If `skip-create-bosh-admin-client: true` is specified, manual steps are required,
    and this task is no longer "automation".
  
- [`create-vm`][create-vm] and [`upgrade-opsman`][upgrade-opsman] now function with `gcp_service_account_name` on GCP.
  Previously, only providing a full `gcp_service_account` as a JSON blob worked.
- Environment variables passed to [`create-vm`][create-vm], [`delete-vm`][delete-vm], and [`upgrade-opsman`][upgrade-opsman]
  will be passed to the underlying IAAS CLI invocation.
  This allows our tasks to work with the `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` variables
  that can be [set in Concourse](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-release/blob/9764b66a6d85785735f6ea8ddcabf77785b5eddd/jobs/worker/spec#L50-L65).
- [`download-product`][download-product] task output of `assign-stemcell.yml` will have the correct `product-name`
- When using the `env.yml` for a task,
  extra values passed in the env file will now fail if they are not recognized properties.
  Invalid properties might now produce the following:
    ```bash
      $ om --env env.yml upload-product --product product.pivotal
      could not parse env file: yaml: unmarshal errors:
      line 5: field invalid-field not found in type main.options
    ```
  
- `credhub` CLI has been bumped to v2.5.1.
  This includes a fix of not raising an error when processing an empty YAML file.
- `om` CLI has been bumped to v2.0.0.
  This includes the following bug fixes:
    * `download-product` will now return a `download-file.json` 
      if `stemcell-iaas` is defined but the product has no stemcell.
      Previously, this would exit gracefully, but not return a file. 
    * Non-string environment variables can now be read and passed as strings to Ops Manager.
      For example, if your environment variable (`OM_NAME`) is set to `"123"` (with quotes escaped),
      it will be evaluated in your config file with the quotes.
      
        Given `config.yml`
        ```yaml
        value: ((NAME))
        ```
        
        `om interpolate -c config.yml --vars-env OM`
        
        Will evaluate to:
        ```yaml
          value: "123"
        ```
      
    * `bosh-env` will now set `BOSH_ALL_PROXY` without a trailing slash if one is provided
    * When using `bosh-env`, a check is done to ensure the SSH private key exists.
      If does not the command will exit 1.
    * `config-template` will enforce the default value for a property to always be `configurable: false`.
      This is inline with the OpsManager behaviour.

## v3.0.1
**Release Date** Friday, May 24th, 2019

### Breaking Changes
- `om` will now follow conventional Semantic Versioning,
  with breaking changes in major bumps,
  non-breaking changes for minor bumps,
  and bug fixes for patches.
- The [`credhub-interpolate`](./reference/task.md#credhub-interpolate) task can have multiple
  interpolation paths. The `INTERPOLATION_PATH` param is now plural: `INTERPOLATION_PATHS`.
  IF you are using a custom `INTERPOLATION_PATH` for `credhub-interpolate`, you will need to update
  your `pipeline.yml` to this new param.
  As an example, if your credhub-interpolate job is defined as so:
```yaml 
# OLD pipeline.yml PRIOR TO 3.0.0 RELEASE
- name: example-credhub-interpolate
  plan:
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
  - get: platform-automation-image
  - get: config
  - task: credhub-interpolate
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/credhub-interpolate.yml
    input_mapping:
      files: config
    params:
      # all required
      CREDHUB_CA_CERT: ((credhub_ca_cert))
      CREDHUB_CLIENT: ((credhub_client))
      CREDHUB_SECRET: ((credhub_secret))
      CREDHUB_SERVER: ((credhub_server))
      PREFIX: /private-foundation
      INTERPOLATION_PATH: foundation/config-path
      SKIP_MISSING: true 
```
  it should now look like
```yaml hl_lines="19"
# NEW pipeline.yml FOR 3.0.0 RELEASE
- name: example-credhub-interpolate
  plan:
  - get: platform-automation-tasks
  - get: platform-automation-image
  - get: config
  - task: credhub-interpolate
    image: platform-automation-image
    file: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/credhub-interpolate.yml
    input_mapping:
      files: config
    params:
      # all required
      CREDHUB_CA_CERT: ((credhub_ca_cert))
      CREDHUB_CLIENT: ((credhub_client))
      CREDHUB_SECRET: ((credhub_secret))
      CREDHUB_SERVER: ((credhub_server))
      PREFIX: /private-foundation
      INTERPOLATION_PATHS: foundation/config-path
      SKIP_MISSING: true 
```

- the [`upload-product`](./reference/task.md#upload-product) option `--sha256` has been changed to `--shasum`. 
  IF you are using the `--config` flag in `upload-product`, your config file will need to update from:
```yaml
# OLD upload-product-config.yml PRIOR TO 3.0.0 RELEASE
product-version: 1.2.3-build.4
sha256: 6daededd8fb4c341d0cd437a
```
  to:
```yaml hl_lines="3"
# NEW upload-product-config.yml FOR 3.0.0 RELEASE
product-version: 1.2.3-build.4
shasum: 6daededd8fb4c341d0cd437a # NOTE the name of this value is changed 
```
  This change was added to future-proof the param name for when sha256 is no longer the 
  de facto way of defining shasums.

### What's New
- The new command [`assign-multi-stemcell`](./reference/task.md#assign-multi-stemcell) assigns multiple stemcells to a provided product.
  This feature is only available in OpsMan 2.6+.
- [`download-product`](./reference/task.md#download-product) ensures sha sum checking when downloading the file from Pivotal Network.
- [`download-product`](./reference/task.md#download-product) can now disable ssl validation when connecting to Pivotal Network.
  This helps with environments with SSL and proxying issues.
  Add `pivnet-disable-ssl: true` in your [download-product-config] to use this feature.
- On [GCP](./reference/inputs-outputs.md#gcp), if you did not assign a public IP, Google would assign
  one for you. This has been changed to only assign a public IP if defined in your `opsman.yml`.
- On [Azure](./reference/inputs-outputs.md#azure), if you did not assign a public IP, Azure would assign
  one for you. This has been changed to only assign a public IP if defined in your `opsman.yml`.
- `om interpolate` (example in the [test task](./reference/task.md#test-interpolate)) now supports
   the ability to accept partial vars files. This is added support for users who may also be using 
   credhub-interpolate or who want to mix interpolation methods. To make use of this feature, include
   the `--skip-missing` flag.
- [`credhub-interpolate`](./reference/task.md#credhub-interpolate) now supports the `SKIP_MISSING`
   parameter. For more information on how to use this feature and if it fits for your foundation(s), see the 
   [Secrets Handling](./configuration-management/secrets-handling.md#multiple-sources) section.
- the [reference pipeline](./pipeline/multiple-products.md) has been updated to give an example of 
  [`credhub-interpolate`](./reference/task.md#credhub-interpolate) in practice. For more information
  about credhub, see [Secrets Handling](./configuration-management/secrets-handling.md#multiple-sources) 
- `om` now has support for `config-template` (a Platform Automation encouraged replacement of 
   `tile-config-generator`). This is a experimental command that can only be run currently using `docker run`. 
   For more information and instruction on how to use `config-template`, please see 
   [Creating a Product Config File](./configuration-management/creating-a-product-config-file.md#from-pivnet).
- [`upload-stemcell`](./reference/task.md#upload-stemcell) now supports the ability to include a config file.
  This allows you to define an expected `shasum` that will validate the calculated shasum of the provided 
  `stemcell` uploaded in the task. This was added to give feature parity with [`upload-product`](./reference/task.md#upload-product)
- [Azure](./reference/inputs-outputs.md#azure) now allows NSG(network security group) to be optional.
  This change was made because NSGs can be assigned at the subnet level rather than just the VM level. This
  param is also not required by the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest). 
  Platform Automation now reflects this.
- [staged-director-config](./reference/task.md#staged-director-config) now supports returning multiple IaaS 
  configurations. `iaas-configurations` is a top level key returned in Ops Manager 2.2+. If using an Ops
  Manager 2.1 or earlier, `iaas_configuration` will continue to be a key nested under `properties-configuration`.
- [configure-director](./reference/task.md#configure-director) now supports setting multiple IaaS configurations. 
  If using this feature, be sure to use the top-level `iaas-configurations` key, rather than the nested 
  `properties-configuration.iaas_configuration` key. If using a single IaaS, `properties-configuration.iaas_configuration`
  is still supported, but the new `iaas_configurations` top-level key is recommended.
  
    ```yaml hl_lines="2"
    # Configuration for 2.2+
    iaas-configurations:
    - additional_cloud_properties: {}
      name: ((iaas-configurations_0_name))
    - additional_cloud_properties: {}
      name: ((iaas-configurations_1_name))
      ...
    networks-configuration: ...
    properties-configuration: ...
    ```

    ```yaml hl_lines="5"
    # Configuration 2.1 and earlier
    networks-configuration: ...
    properties-configuration:
        director_configuration: ...
        iaas_configuration:
          additional_cloud_properties: {}
          name: ((iaas-configurations_0_name))
          ...
        security_configuration: ...
    ```

### Bug Fixes
- OpenStack would sometimes be unable to associate the public IP when creating the VM, because it was 
  waiting for the VM to come up. The `--wait` flag has been added to validate that the VM creation is
  complete before more work is done to the VM.
- [`credhub-interpolate`][credhub-interpolate] now accepts multiple files for the `INTERPOLATION_PATHS`. 
- CVE update to container image. Resolves [USN-3911-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3911-1/)
  (related to vulnerabilities with `libmagic1`. While none of our code directly used these,
  they are present on the image.)
- Improved error messaging for [vSphere](./reference/inputs-outputs.md#gcp) VM creation if neither `ssh-password` or `ssh-public-key` are set.
  One or the other is required to create a VM.
- `upgrade-opsman` would incorrectly parse meta information from the `download-product`
  prefixing if using S3. This lead to some unexpected upgrading behavior.
  Now, the task will correctly upgrade if the semver is higher.
