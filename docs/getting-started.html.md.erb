# Getting Started

If you are using Platform Automation Toolkit for the first time,
you have a few options.

Our [Overview](./index.html) of Platform Automation Toolkit describes it conceptually,
and is useful to review prior to diving into more technical content.

## How-to Guides

We have in-depth procedures for deploying a new Operations Manager and
taking over management of an existing Operations Manager
with Platform Automation Toolkit:
