If you are using Platform Automation Toolkit for the first time,
you have a few options.

Our [Overview](./index.html) of Platform Automation Toolkit describes it conceptually,
and is useful to review prior to diving into more technical content.

## How-to Guides

We have in-depth procedures for deploying a new Ops Manager and
