# Getting started

If you are using Platform Automation Toolkit for the first time,
you have a few options.

Our [Overview](./index.md) of Platform Automation Toolkit describes it conceptually,
and is useful to review prior to diving into more technical content.

## How-to guides

We have in-depth procedures for deploying a new Tanzu Operations Manager and
taking over management of an existing Tanzu Operations Manager
with Platform Automation Toolkit:

- For more information about deploying Concourse with CredHub and User Account and Authentication (UAA),
  see [Install Concourse for Platform Automation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Concourse-for-VMware-Tanzu/index.html).
- For more information about deploying Platform Automation Toolkit
  with a new Tanzu Operations Manager, see [Installing Tanzu Operations Manager](./how-to-guides/installing-opsman.md).
- For more information about deploying Platform Automation Toolkit
  with an existing Tanzu Operations Manager, see
  [Upgrading an existing Tanzu Operations Manager](./how-to-guides/upgrade-existing-opsman.md).
