platform: linux

inputs:
- name: platform-automation-tasks
- name: state # contains the state for the vm
- name: config # contains the OpsMan configuration file
- name: image # contains the image file to be installed
- name: installation # contains the installation to be imported
- name: env # contains the environment information for OpsMan
- name: vars # variable files to be made available
  optional: true
- name: secrets # secret files to be made available
  # separate from vars, so they can be stored securely
  optional: true

outputs:
- name: generated-state #contains the updated state file

params:
  VARS_FILES:
  # - Optional
  # - space-seperated array of filepaths to YAML vars files
  #   to be loaded with the OPSMAN_CONFIG_FILE
  # - relative to root of the task build,
  #   so both `vars` and `secrets` can be used.

  ENV_FILE: env.yml
  # - Required
  # - filepath of the env config YAML
  # - relative to root of the `env` input

  OPSMAN_CONFIG_FILE: opsman.yml
  # - Required
  # - filepath of the opsman config YAML
  # - relative to root of the `config` input
  # - to configure Ops Manager Application Settings
  #   (such as banner, pivnet token, etc)
  #   add this configuration to your opsman.yml

  STATE_FILE: state.yml
  # - Required
  # - Filepath of the state yaml file
  # - The path is relative to root of the `state` output
  # - if the filename includes "$timestamp",
  #   for example "state-$timestamp.yml",
  #   the final filename will include the current timestamp.
  #   - this is necessary if using an "S3 compatible" blobstore
  #     that doesn't support versioned blobs
  #   - timestamped filenames will need to be represented
  #     with a glob-style wildcard in tasks that use this state file
  #     (such as state-*.yml)

  INSTALLATION_FILE: installation*.zip
  # - Required
  # - filepath of the installation ZIP file
  # - can be wildcard expanded
  # - relative to root of the `installation` input

run:
  path: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/upgrade-opsman.sh
# code_snippet upgrade-opsman end
