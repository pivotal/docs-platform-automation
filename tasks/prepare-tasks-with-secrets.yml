inputs:
  - name: platform-automation-tasks
  - name: tasks
    # Contains the task files that will be modified to contain secrets
    # as environment variables
  - name: config
    # Contains the config files with (()) parameterized variables
  - name: vars
    # Optional input for variables to be made available for use with VARS_PATHS
    # - See the VARS_PATHS param for more information

outputs:
  - name: tasks
    # contains the modified tasks

params:
  CONFIG_PATHS: config
  # - Optional
  # - Paths of the directories containing the config files
  # - The path is relative to root of the task build
  # - Child folders will be recursively searched

  VARS_PATHS:
  # - Optional
  # - Variables found under files in VARS_PATHS
  #   will not be added to tasks for lookup
  #   from Concourse's credential manager.
  #   If VARS_FILES are used in later tasks,

  # - If VARS_PATH is not set and the vars input is provided,
  #   VARS_PATH will be set to the root of the vars input
  # - The path is relative to root of the task build
  # - Child folders will be recursively searched
