platform: linux

inputs:
- name: platform-automation-tasks
- name: env # contains the env file with target OpsMan Information

outputs:
- name: installation # will contain the exported installation

params:
  ENV_FILE: env.yml
  # - Required
  # - Filepath of the env config YAML
  # - The path is relative to root of the `env` input

  INSTALLATION_FILE: installation-$timestamp.zip
  # - Required
  # - Filepath of the installation ZIP file
  # - The path is relative to root of the `installation` output
  # - if the filename includes "$timestamp",
  #   for example "installation-$timestamp.zip",
  #   the final filename will include the current timestamp.
  #   - this is necessary if using an "S3 compatible" blobstore
  #     that doesn't support versioned blobs
  #   - timestamped filenames will need to be represented
  #     with a glob-style wildcard in the `upgrade-opsman` task configuration
  #     (the default will work with the example provided above).

run:
  path: platform-automation-tasks/tasks/export-installation.sh
