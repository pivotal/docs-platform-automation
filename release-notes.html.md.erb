### Bug Fixes:

* `staged-config`: Change top-level-key from `product_name` to `product-name` to match the schema of `configure-product`

* `create-vm`: Able specify private IP and/or public IP. Only one is required to be set.
* `staged-config`: Able to pull errand config.
* `configure-director`: Able to configure bosh vm extensions

### Bug Fixes:

* `upgrade-opsman`: Fix a failure in argument parsing causing upgrade fails silently.

### Breaking:

##<a id="v0.0.1-rc174"></a> v0.0.1-rc174

**Release Date:** September 21, 2018

Features included in this release:

* cleaning up resources in Azure, GCP, OpenStack when deleting the vm

* the latest `om` which includes the ability to specify `vm-extensions` key in the director config file. 

* a script for building a Docker image 

Breaking changes in this release:

* The auth resource has been split into two pieces, an `auth` file and an `env` file. The `auth` resource is now referred to as the `env` resource, and the `auth` file is now going to exist in the config resource. You can see how to create those inputs in the task reference of the documentation. This breaking changes effects existing rcs but should only involve changes to the pipeline.yml if you are using the new tasks.
