These are release notes for Platform Automation for PCF.

##<a id="v0.0.1-rc228"></a> v0.0.1-rc229

**Release Date:** October 12, 2018

### Features
* `p-automator -v` will return the version number of the release
* all tasks except `create-vm`, `delete-vm`, and `upgrade-opsman` are using `om`
* `om --env` now includes `decryption-passphrase` to automatically unlock the VM
  when performing a command on a rebooted VM

### Breaking Changes
* `import-installation` no longer takes an `auth.yml`, which used to contain `decryption-passphrase`.
  Now it is required to set the `decryption-passphrase` in the `env.yml` when using the task. See
  [env file](http://docs-platform-automation.cfapps.io/pcf-automation/alpha/task-reference.html#env)
* `upgrade-opsman` invokes `import-installation` behind the scene, so the breaking change applies to this
  command as well. This mean that `upgrade-opsman` task no longer requires the `auth.yml`, but requires
  `decryption-passphrase` to be in the `env.yml`.

### Bug fix
* when specifying `STATE_FILE` it will only be used to identify the input.
  The `generated_state` will always just have `state.yml` for the output file name.

##<a id="v0.0.1-rc214"></a> v0.0.1-rc214

**Release Date:** October 9, 2018

### Features
* the docker image is now both a concourse `garden-runc` and `docker import`able image
* added support to choose the Azure Cloud by setting `cloud_name` in your Ops Man VM config.
  The default is AzureCloud for the Americas. Other clouds can be found by running `az cloud list`.
* `om staged-config` now returns any vm-extensions set for a product
* `om configure-product` will now associate vm-extensions with a product


### Bug Fixes:
* `create-vm`, `upgrade-opsman`, and `delete-vm`: Will output the correct `ipath` for VSphere created VMs.
  The pattern is `/datacenter/vm/folder/vm-name` if you would like to backfix your state file.
* `om staged-director-config` works with Azure Ops Man Vms as they don't have availability zones 

##<a id="v0.0.1-rc194"></a> v0.0.1-rc194

**Release Date:** October 3, 2018

### Features
* `create-vm`: Configurable instance type on AWS, see https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ for supported instance types.
* docker-image: Now shipping with docker image instead of self-service buildpack. See [Getting-Started](getting-started.html)
  about how to use the image. It is based off the `cflinuxfs3` image.
* `staged-config` includes the errands and vm-extensions of the specified product

### Bug Fixes:
* docs: `configure-saml-authentication`: Fix the top-level-keys of sample configuration 
* `staged-config`: Change top-level-key from `product_name` to `product-name` to match the schema of `configure-product`
* show error message when `import-installation` fails during the `upgrade-opsman`

##<a id="v0.0.1-rc181"></a> v0.0.1-rc181

**Release Date:** September 27, 2018

### Features
* `create-vm`: Shared VPC support for GCP. See [docs](task-reference.html#gcp-configuration) about the configuration.
* `create-vm`: Able to specify private IP for all supported IAASs (aws, azure, gcp, openstack, vsphere).
* `create-vm`: Able specify private IP and/or public IP. Only one is required to be set.
* `staged-config`: Able to pull errand config.
* `configure-director`: Able to configure bosh vm extensions

### Bug Fixes:
* `configure-product`: Fix a non-deterministic behavior regarding collection type properties due to inconsistency in guid.
* `upgrade-opsman`: Fix a failure in argument parsing causing upgrade fails silently.

### Breaking:
* `staged-config`: flag change from `--include-placeholder` --> `--include-placeholders` (pluralize).
  The task has been updated and usage should be unaffected. 

##<a id="v0.0.1-rc174"></a> v0.0.1-rc174

**Release Date:** September 21, 2018

Features included in this release:

* cleaning up resources in Azure, GCP, OpenStack when deleting the vm

* the latest `om` which includes the ability to specify `vm-extensions` key in the director config file. 

* a script for building a Docker image 

Breaking changes in this release:

* The auth resource has been split into two pieces, an `auth` file and an `env` file. The `auth` resource is now referred to as the `env` resource, and the `auth` file is now going to exist in the config resource. You can see how to create those inputs in the task reference of the documentation. This breaking changes effects existing rcs but should only involve changes to the pipeline.yml if you are using the new tasks.
